Grant application files for a potential European H2020 grant around Sage
========================================================================

At the occasion of a presentation of the European H2020 call for
grants, I (Nicolas M. Thi√©ry) started discussing opportunities for
Sage. From those discussions, it seems a good bet could be the call
EINFRA-9: e-Infrastructure for Virtual Research Environment.

The purpose would be to have a regular source of funding for:

- Sage Days and smaller developers meetings,

- Research engineers, students, postdocs (?), etc spending time on Sage development,

- Hardware,

- Possibly: subcontracting to other projects, buying teaching reliefs, ...

Other grant opportunities can and should be explored (e.g. COST
networks).

Time line
---------

- Friday March 21st 2014: Application for financial support to prepare the proposal [1]
- January 2015: Proposal submission
- September 2015: Start

[1] The CNRS INS2I institute is offering support (up to 5000 euros)
for preparing such proposals. This money could be used e.g. to
organize a Sage Days this year geared toward this grant (and real work
too!). To apply for such support we need to file a 3-5 page draft with
a tentative list of partner institutions and number of participant in
each of them.

Scope
-----

European H2020 calls concern countries in Europe as well as
`associated countries and third countries <http://ec.europa.eu/research/participants/docs/h2020-funding-guide/cross-cutting-issues/international-cooperation_en.htm>`_.
Just to mention a couple where I can think of Sage developers and
users from the top of my head, this includes e.g. Switzerland, Israel,
Senegal, or South Africa.

The current `Sketch of project description <project-description.tex>`_
grew up from previous attempts at the scale of Sage-Combinat in
France; there remains traces which should of course be cleared! At
this point, the themes and actions of the would-be proposal are widely
open: research & teaching in all branches of mathematics and related
fields where Sage could be useful, user interface, data, ... We should
start from what the participants will propose, or better offer
workforce for, and then see how to make it coherent. See and edit the
`Tentative target features and actions <actions.tex>`_ file.


Join!
-----

`Consortium (in building) <consortium.tex>`_

If you are tentatively interested in joining as a participant, PI, or
even better lead PI, please join the `mailing list
<https://listes.services.cnrs.fr/wws/info/sagemath-grant-europe>`_,
and send an e-mail there with:

- Name, e-mail
- Status, institute
- trac & github account if you have them
- Whatever ideas you may have for the project

I will add you to the collaborators on this githup project so that you
can start editing the information. In particular, check and edit the
information in the `consortium <consortium.tex>`_ and `target feature
<actions.tex>`_ files.

And again: if anyone feels like taking on / sharing the lead,
please!!!
