Grant application files for a potential European H2020 grant around Sage
========================================================================

At the occasion of a presentation of the European H2020 call for
grants, I (Nicolas M. Thiéry) started discussing opportunities for
Sage with Eugénia Shadlova (in charge of European projects at
Université Paris-Sud) and Jean-Pierre Caminade (research
infrastructure mission in the french research ministry). From those
discussions, it seems a good bet could be the call EINFRA-9:
e-Infrastructure for Virtual Research Environment. The time line would
be a submission in January 2015, with funding starting 8 months after
the submission.

So now is a good time to start thinking about it. This in particular
since the French CNRS INS2I institute is offering support (up to 5000
euros) for preparing such proposals, with an application deadline on
the 21st (this Friday!). This money could be used e.g. to organize a
Sage-Days this year geared toward this grant (and real work too!).

Scope
-----

European H2020 calls concern countries in Europe as well as associated
countries and third countries as listed
`here <http://ec.europa.eu/research/participants/docs/h2020-funding-guide/cross-cutting-issues/international-cooperation_en.htm>`_.
Just to mention a couple where I can think of Sage developers and
users from the top of my head, this includes e.g. Switzerland, Israel,
Senegal, or South Africa.

The current `Sketch of project description <project-description.tex>`_
grew up from previous attempts at the scale of Sage-Combinat in
France; there remains traces which should of course be cleared! At
this point, the themes of the grant are widely open: research &
teaching in all branches of mathematics and related fields where Sage
could be useful, user interface, data, ... We should start from what
the participants will propose, or better offer workforce for, and then
see how to make it coherent.

Join!

`Consortium (in building) <consortium.tex>`_

If you are tentatively interested in joining as a participant, PI, or
even better lead PI, please join the mailing list `mailing list
<https://listes.services.cnrs.fr/wws/info/sagemath-grant-europe>`_,
and send an e-mail there with:

- Name, e-mail
- Status, institute
- trac & github account if you have them
- Whatever ideas you may have for the project

I will add you to the collaborators on this githup project so that you
can start editing the information. In particular, check and edit the
information in the `consortium <consortium.tex>`_ and `target feature
<target_feature.tex>`_.

Other grant opportunities can and should be explored (e.g. COST
networks). And again: if anyone feels like taking on / sharing the
lead, please!!!
