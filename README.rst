European grant applications for the Sage ecosystem
==================================================

The purpose of this project is to explore and pursue grant
applications for the Sage ecosystem and related mathematical software,
in order to get regular source of funding in Europe for:

- Full time developers, students, etc working on those general purpose
  technical tasks that don't fit well in the "developed by users for
  users" model and thus can't be funded indirectly through usual
  research grants.

- Workshops (e.g. Sage Days, Pari Days, joint Sage/Singular days, ...)
  for development and training, smaller developers meetings, training
  sessions, travel, visits, ...

- Hardware and computational resources (e.g. cloud),

- Possibly: subcontracting to other projects,

- Possibly: buying teaching relief, partial funding of senior
  researchers to work on software aspects, ...

- Possibly: postdocs with e.g. strong computational or software design
  research topics,

- Fostering collaboration and symbiosis within and between software
  components and developer communities.

At this stage, we are preparing two grant applications:

- A `COST <Cost.rst>`_ network focused on the second point above,
  targeting a wide consortium.

- A European H2020 application for the call `EINFRA-9:
  e-Infrastructure for Virtual Research Environment
  <http://ec.europa.eu/research/participants/portal/desktop/en/opportunities/h2020/topics/2144-einfra-9-2015.html>`_,
  with a more focused consortium, to tackle the other aspects.

Time line
---------

- `8-9 September 2014: Preparatory meeting <2014-09-08-meeting.rst>`_
- `Meeting report <2014-09-08-meeting-report.rst>`_
- January 2015: H2020 Proposal submission
- January 2015: Cost Proposal submission
- September 2015: Start
- Duration: 3-5 years

Join!

If you are tentatively interested in joining as a participant, PI, or
even better lead PI of a proposal, please join the `mailing list
<https://listes.services.cnrs.fr/wws/info/sagemath-grant-europe>`_,
and send an e-mail there with:

- Name, e-mail
- Status, institute
- trac & github account if you have them
- Whatever ideas you may have for the proposals

We will add you to the collaborators on this githup project so that
you can start editing the information. In particular, check and edit
the information in the `COST consortium <consortium.tex>`_ and `target
feature <actions.tex>`_ files.

You are welcome to explore other opportunities for grant applications,
centered for example on teaching, ...
