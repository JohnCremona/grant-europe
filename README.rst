Grant application files for a potential European H2020 grant around Sage
========================================================================

At the occasion of a presentation of the European H2020 call for
grants, I (Nicolas M. Thi√©ry) started discussing opportunities for the
Sage ecosystem. From those discussions, it seems a good bet could be
the call `EINFRA-9: e-Infrastructure for Virtual Research Environment <http://ec.europa.eu/research/participants/portal/desktop/en/opportunities/h2020/topics/2144-einfra-9-2015.html>`_.

The purpose would be to have a regular source of funding for:

- Full time developers, students, etc working on the Sage ecosystem at
  large, with a focus on those general purpose technical tasks that
  don't fit well in the "developed by users for users" model and thus
  can't be funded indirectly through usual research grants.

- Workshops (e.g. Sage Days, Pari Days) for development and training,
  smaller developers meetings, training sessions, visits, ...

- Hardware and computational ressources

- Possibly: subcontracting to other projects,

- Possibly: buying teaching reliefs, ...

- Possibly: postdocs with a strong computational aspect.

- Fostering collaboration

Simultaneously, we will apply for a COST network focused on the second
point above.

Scope
-----

European H2020 calls concern countries in Europe as well as
`associated countries and third countries <http://ec.europa.eu/research/participants/docs/h2020-funding-guide/cross-cutting-issues/international-cooperation_en.htm>`_.
Just to mention a couple where I can think of Sage developers and
users from the top of my head, this includes e.g. Switzerland, Israel,
Senegal, or South Africa.

At this point, the perimeter, themes, and actions of the would-be
proposal are widely open: research & teaching in all branches of
mathematics and related fields where Sage could be useful, user
interface, database, collaborative research tools, ... The difficulty
will be to define what we mean by ``e-Infrastructure for Virtual
Research Environment'' in our context.

I believe we should start from the potential concrete actions that the
participants will propose, or better offer workforce for, and then see
how to make it coherent. See and edit the `Tentative target features
and actions <actions.tex>`_ file.


Join!
-----

If you are tentatively interested in joining as a participant, PI, or
even better lead PI, please join the `mailing list
<https://listes.services.cnrs.fr/wws/info/sagemath-grant-europe>`_,
and send an e-mail there with:

- Name, e-mail
- Status, institute
- trac & github account if you have them
- Whatever ideas you may have for the project

We will add you to the collaborators on this githup project so that
you can start editing the information. In particular, check and edit
the information in the `consortium <consortium.tex>`_ and `target
feature <actions.tex>`_ files.

And again: if anyone feels like taking on / sharing the lead,
please!!!
