- Busting the ``Sage is American myth``

  Task: Optimize the mission statement and write a few paragraphs for
  the proposal to bust this myth. Some material:

  - The developers map, location of Sage days, ...

  - Sage is a technocracy; like the development, the leadership is
    completely distributed. The more Europe gets involved, the more it
    influences the governance.

  - From the beginning, Sage has included many European projects (GAP, Singular, ...)

  - Sage has been indirectly funded by European/French/... grants

  - Sage has been benefiting European researchers and teachers for a
    long time; maybe it's time that not only the NSF funds it
