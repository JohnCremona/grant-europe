Work Package Clusters
===================

Revised Tuesday morning

Some of these packages may well get split further or merged. The distinction between
Package Groups is just for us, the Commission doesn't see it.

Package Group 1: Software Architecture and Interfaces

Overview – develop and validate a software architecture building on  relevant
prior art, techniques from other communities, etc. into which a  wide range of
components can be plugged to develop flexible bespoke VREs for particular
communities and projects.


	Emerging Technology: 	produce periodic reviews of relevant developments
	elsewhere and implications		for our plans, including negotiating access or
	shared development if appropriate

	Community Building & Engagement:
		Reports on community needs
		Open workshops (SAGE Days etc.)
		Large demonstrators
		General travel  budget


	Component Architecture:	develop and demonstrate a set of APIs enabling
	components such as database interfaces, computational modules, separate
	systems such as

		GAP, SAGE to be flexibly combined and run smoothly across a range of
		environments (cloud, local, server, ...). Pick up standard components/service
		for storage and sharing, authentication etc. Recomputation connection
		belongs here?

		Need to dig into what Jupyter have done

		Collaboration with unreliable networking connections (peer-to-peer,
		opportunistic syncing, 3rd world). This is technically interesting, and gets
		in support for non-networked working. Not sure if it belongs here or not.


	User Interface:s 	UI design, flexible portable interfaces, iPython ++ (liaison w
	iPython devels) 	multilingual UI? Usability

		Some demonstrators around here

	Supporting the Mathematical Process
		collaboration tools, links to publication and archival, etc.
		appropriate roles for proof/programme checking [does this belong here]

		Includes one or two demonstrator deliverables (or make them related WPs)
		If we have a publisher, maybe split that part out to give them a WP to lead
		Informed by the social stuff.

Development Models for an Academic Free Software Ecosystem
		Sharing best practices, practices that respect academic requirements (credit etc.)
		development models that embrace more than one project – has social and 			technical aspects

	Next Generation Mathematical Databases: 	Design interfaces that can be used for
	a wide range of mathematical data, 	facilities for accepting contributions
	while tracking provenance and credit 	standard metadata allowing database
	discovery 	versioning allowing stable references, citability, recomputation
	without copying 		entire database into  VM

		Warwick, Paul Oliver Dehaye, Logilab? (SME in Paris)


Package Group 2 Social Aspects

studying how collaboration, publication, acceptance, linking computations to
publications etc could work in the real community

studying social aspects of mathematical software development models


Other Possible Packages
Management, dissemination etc.
