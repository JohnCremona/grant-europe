Work Package Clusters
===================

Revised Tuesday morning

Some of these packages may well get split further or merged. The distinction between
Package Groups is just for us, the Commission doesn't see it.

Software Architecture and Interfaces
====================================

Overview – develop and validate a software architecture building on  relevant
prior art, techniques from other communities, etc. into which a  wide range of
components can be plugged to develop flexible bespoke VREs for particular
communities and projects.


Emerging Technology
-------------------

Produce periodic reviews of relevant developments elsewhere and
implications for our plans, including negotiating access or shared
development if appropriate

Community Building & Engagement
-------------------------------

- Reports on community needs
- Open workshops (Sage Days, Pari Days, summer schools, etc.)
- Both for development and training
- General travel  budget
- Large demonstrators

Component Architecture
----------------------

Develop and demonstrate a set of APIs enabling components such as
database interfaces, computational modules, separate systems such as
GAP, SAGE to be flexibly combined and run smoothly across a range of
environments (cloud, local, server, ...).

Pick up standard components/service for storage and sharing,
authentication etc. Recomputation connection belongs here?

Need to dig into what Jupyter have done

Collaboration with unreliable networking connections (peer-to-peer,
opportunistic syncing, 3rd world). This is technically interesting,
and gets in support for non-networked working. Not sure if it belongs
here or not.

- Self adaptation to the environment, better schemes for automatically
  selecting appropriate algorithms / components for a given task.

- Modularisation of Sage.

Standardisation
---------------

Either as a package by itself, or subpackage of the previous one.

- API's
- Possibly building on OpenMath / SCSCP / ...
- Notebook formats
- Virtualization

User Interfaces
---------------

UI design, flexible portable interfaces, iPython ++ (liaison w iPython
devels) multilingual UI? Usability

.. TODO:: include here everything about this topic in Needs.rst

Some demonstrators around here

Supporting the Mathematical Process
-----------------------------------

Collaboration tools, links to publication and archival, etc.
appropriate roles for proof/programme checking [does this belong here]

Includes one or two demonstrator deliverables (or make them related
WPs) If we have a publisher, maybe split that part out to give them a
WP to lead Informed by the social stuff.

Interactions with Calculemus / Theorema / Coq / Gonthier / ...

Development Models for an Academic Free Software Ecosystem
----------------------------------------------------------

Sharing best practices, practices that respect academic requirements
(credit etc.)  development models that embrace more than one project –
has social and technical aspects

Next Generation Mathematical Databases
--------------------------------------

Design interfaces that can be used for a wide range of mathematical
data, facilities for accepting contributions while tracking provenance
and credit standard metadata allowing database discovery versioning
allowing stable references, citability, recomputation without copying
entire database into VM

Warwick, Paul Oliver Dehaye, Logilab? (SME in Paris)

Social Aspects
--------------

Studying how collaboration, publication, acceptance, linking
computations to publications etc could work in the real community

Studying social aspects of mathematical software development models


Other Possible Packages
=======================

Management, dissemination etc.


Points that will need to be argued
==================================

- Why Sage as technical platform for this project?

  Among the open-source platforms Sage is natural ...
