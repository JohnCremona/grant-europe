On the agenda
=============

Grant title
-----------

First draft:

SageMath in Europe: Mutualized development
of computer exploration environment
for research in mathematics

Task: improve it (it's too narrow)

Mission statement for the grant
-------------------------------

Initial draft:

To boost the ``Sage Ecosystem'' to scale to mainstream and assume its
leadership as virtual environment for computational mathematics by:

- Structuring the community in Europe

- Supporting actions and components developed in Europe


Task: improve this

Questions:

- What is the ``Sage Ecosystem''? Is this inclusive enough?
 ``Sage`` itself is just one of the components!

  Task: draw a picture

- How to include all aspects: teaching / research / ...?

- Busting the ``Sage is American myth``

  Task: Optimize the mission statement and write a few paragraphs for
  the proposal to bust this myth. Some material:

  - The developers map, location of Sage days, ...

  - Sage is a technocracy; like the development, the leadership is
    completely distributed. The more Europe gets involved, the more it
    influences the governance.

  - From the beginning, Sage has included many European projects (GAP, Singular, ...)

  - Sage has been indirectly funded by European/French/... grants

  - Sage has been benefiting European researchers and teachers for a
    long time; maybe it's time that not only the NSF funds it

Purpose of the grant
--------------------

Foster collaboration within and between components

Get a regular source of funding for:

- Full time developers, students, etc working on the Sage ecosystem at
  large, with a focus on those general purpose technical tasks that
  don't fit well in the "developed by users for users" model and thus
  can't be funded indirectly through usual research grants.

- Workshops (e.g. Sage Days, ...) and smaller developers meetings,
  training sessions, short to long term visits, ...

- Hardware,

- Possibly: subcontracting to other projects,

- Possibly: buying teaching reliefs, ...

- Possibly: postdocs with a strong computational aspect.

- Possibly: senior positions?

Consortium
----------

Main difficulties
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- The community is very dispersed
- Granularity: what's the right size for a node?
- What are the administrative constraints on a node?
- How much is it possible to attach isolated participants to a node?

Main nodes
^^^^^^^^^^

- Orsay
- Bordeaux
- St Andrews?
- Kaiserslautern?
- Warwick
- University of Silesia
- ...

Overview of the activities
--------------------------

(starting point suggested by Steve):

UI developments
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

A modern, robust notebook interface for computation supporting
real-time sharing, integration with collaborative problem-solving,
paper writing and publication, links to databases etc.

System developments
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

A more uniform framework for linking computational tools across the
internet

Cloud integration
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Private and commercial clouds *

Database tools
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Including mechanisms for making data citable, finding data, tracking
provenance and so on

Integration with publication in open-access journals
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Collaborative tools
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- For research projects
- For software development
- For teaching

Teaching material
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Maybe integration of a proof-checker/theorem prover
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Maybe Parallelism?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Project management and coordination
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
