person-month figure in bold.}

By design \TheProject is attacking upfront the diverse needs of a
very large community: pure maths and applications. Thanks to its
toolkit approach, it will impact users in many areas of science. This
is a major long term investment which requires the extensive expertise
of a large consortium and the improvement of a great number of
software components. The complex technical nature of the project,
combined with the high quality requirements for guaranteeing long term
sustainability, necessitates recruiting highly experienced software
engineers to complement the participants. Much emphasis is put as well
on studying the social aspects and implementing many demonstrators to
illustrate the breath and depth of potential applications.

This all explains the considerable staff efforts displayed in the
following table.
\wpfig[label=fig:staffeffort,caption=Summary of Staff Efforts]


\paragraph{Travel, dissemination, and outreach}

The community-building nature of this grant proposal requires a large
number of staff exchanges, workshops with project partners, as well as
workshops engaging the wider community in addition to the usual
management and project review meetings. For dissemination, we need to
target the computer science and computational science-focused
communities and their conferences, as well as the domains benefitting
from \TheProject, such as Mathematics and Physical Sciences.

\subparagraph{Guidelines for travel and dissemination}
\label{sect:budget-details-travel}

We use the following guidelines for expected travel expenses:
\euro{2200} for attendance of a typical one week international
conference outside Europe (including travel, subsistence,
accommodation and registration), \euro{1200} for a corresponding
conference in Europe, \euro{750} for a one-week visit of a  project
partner, for instance for coding sprints and one-to-one 
research visits. We expect a similar cost per week while hosting
visitors. For the half-yearly project meetings, we expect on average a
cost of \euro{400} for travel, accommodation and subsistence.

For a partner site with one investigator and one full time researcher,
we expect that that both will attend all of the 9 project meetings that take
place every 6 months (cost of 9 * 2 * 400 =
\euro{7200}), and that the site spends \euro{2000} per year to host
external visitors contributing to the project (total \euro{8000}). We
expect the investigator and the researcher in total to do 4 one-week visits
to other sites (each at \euro{750}) every year, totaling \euro{12000} over 4 years).

% 9*2*400 + 2000*4 + 4*750*4
For dissemination, we expect the researcher to attend on average 1
international conference and 2 European meetings per year (totals
\euro{18400}) and the investigator to attend one international and one
european gathering (totals \euro{13600}).
% (2*2200 + 3*1200)*4

Where there are multiple investigators per site, they will share the
travel and associated costs outlined above. Where there are multiple
researchers, or researchers not employed for the full 48 months, the
travel budget is reduced accordingly.

\subparagraph{Guidelines for outreach costs}
\label{sect:budget-outreach-publication-charges}
We also request \euro{1000} per year per partner (several partners
have other means do pay these costs, and for them these are not needed) 
to pay for open access publication charges.

\label{sect:budget-outreach-workshops}
We request funds for outreach activities such as workshops that
facilitate community building, disseminate best practice and
encourages sustained contributions of the community to the project and
beyond the lifetime of the funding. For  a one-week workshop reaching
out to the community, we cost these at about 400 EUR per participant
to provide accommodation and catering. A workshop for 15 people will
thus cost about \euro{6000}. Participants donate their time and will fund
their own travel. The particular budgeted cost will depend on the
local availability of accommodation and will thus vary from workshop to
workshop. We use creative means to increase value and improve
community building where possible, for example by cooking food
ourselves as done in this recent workshop
\href{http://wiki.sagemath.org/days57}{http://wiki.sagemath.org/days57}.

Details are given in the tables below and in the work packages.

\subsubsection{Resource summaries for consortium member sites}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%
% Guidelines for completion of partner specific resource summary:
%
%
% Please explain how many person months for each person are
% requested. Say who is the local lead. Say anything that helps to
% understand why people are recruited as you plan, in particular if
% this deviates from having one research for 48 months.  We can also
% use this bit of the proposal (and the table, see below) to address
% any other unusual arrangements.
%
%
% The table should contain all non-staff costs (the EU requests that
% this table must be present if the non-staff costs exceed
% 15% of the total cost, but it is good practice and will show
% openness and transparency that we show the data for all partners).
%
% Link back from the table to the work packages and tasks for which
% the expenses are required. Add information that makes it easier to
% understand why the expenses are justified.
%
%     To refer to a task in a work package, use "\taskref{WP-ID}{TASK-ID}" where
%     WP-ID is the ID of the work package:
%        WP#: WP-ID - full title
%        ----------------------
%        WP1: 'management' - Management
%        WP2: 'community' - Community Building and Engagement
%        WP3: 'component-architecture' - Component Architecture
%        WP4: 'UI' - User interfaces
%        WP5: 'hpc' - High Performance Computing
%        WP6: 'dksbases' - Data/Knowledge/Software-Bases
%        WP7: 'social-aspects' - Social Aspects
%        WP8: 'dissem' - Dissemination
%
%
%     and "TASK-ID" is the ID of the task. You can set this using
%
%       \begin{task}[id=TASK-ID,title=Math Search Engine,lead=JU,PM=10,lead=JU]
%
%     To refer to deliverables, use "\delivref{WP-ID}{DELIV-ID}" where DELIV-ID is
%     the ID of the deliverable that can be set like this:
%
%       \begin{wpdeliv}[due=36,id=DELIV-ID,dissem=PU,nature=DEM]
%           {Exploratory support for semantic-aware interactive widgets providing views on objects
%           represented and or in databases}
%       \end{wpdeliv}
%
%
% The table is pre-populated with entries most sites are likely
% to need. If a line does not apply to you, just delete it. If you need
% an extra line, then add it. Use common sense: the number of rows should not
% be very big, but at the same time it is useful to give some breakdown/explanation
% of costs.
%
%
% Eventually, try to create you entry similar in style to the others.
% (The Southampton entry is fully populated, so use this as guidance
% if in doubt.)

be connected with 3d visualization of data produced by the Lattice
Boltzmann software 'sailfish'. After initial research work done
together with Simula (task leader) will require to subcontract the
development of software visualization.

The justification for subcontracting is as follows. We have much
experience as users of 3d visualization software for fluid
dynamics. However the expertise in Computer Graphics (e.g. WebGL) is
not enough at the Department of Mathematics, Physics and
Chemistry. Instead of building the expertise it is financially more
efficient to specify and outsource the programming task to professionals.

\paragraph{Resources Logilab}

Logilab requests 36 person months for its engineers (Julien Cristau,
Florent Cayré and Olivier Cayrol). They will bring their expertise
(database design, software architecture, computer-domain knowledge) to
numerous tasks, and will notably contribute to the packaging of \Sage
(\taskref{component-architecture}{mod-packaging}), the enhancement of
existing forges (\taskref{component-architecture}{workflow}) and the
addition of HTML5 widgets in notebooks
(\taskref{UI}{dynamic-inspect}).

Logilab requests 12 person months for subcontracting an engineer
(Serge Guelton), main developer of \Pythran, that will work on
\taskref{hpc}{pythran}.

% Travels: 1 conference extra-EU, 4 conferences EU, 9 project meetings for 2 persons, 4 workshops
% 1*2200 + 4*1200 + 2*2000 + (9*2)*400 + 4*750 = 17,200
