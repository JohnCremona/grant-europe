\section{Actions}
\subsection{Collaborative tools}

\begin{itemize}
\item Development of an online repository for indexing and sharing
  notebooks and other Sage resources.
  %\TODO{Be clearer: we want to get rid of notebooks over the
  %  filesystem and .sws tarball}
\item Workflow improvements: continuous integration, ...
\item Collaborative interactive tools: e.g. embedding live shared
  \sage sessions (and more generally IPython) in voice-over-IP or
  teleconference calls.
  % Eugen Dedu:
  % I think such a module can be thought of as a screen-capturing
  % module, i.e. allow Ekiga to capture the screen of a Sage user (this
  % is currently not possible).  This is not a difficult task to do.
  % Julien Puydt: ekiga can do that since something like 2008 with my
  % experimental gstreamer plugin, and I shall be able to present
  % interesting sample code to the ekiga-devel mailing-list in something
  % like two-three weeks (after I'm done with my students), which will
  % hopefully be part of the next version.
  %
  % But as Nicolas noted in his answer, some kind of interative session
  % where people can share a sage session would be better.
  %
  % I think the feature decomposes in the following pieces:
  % - IPython should have a way to share sessions between several
  %   participants using an open and standard protocol ;
  % - ekiga should implement it.

  % Eugen Dedu:
  % In my opinion ekiga, because of its dependency on ptlib and opal
  % libraries and the use of complex protocols like SIP and H323, needs
  % highly technical people.  Students cannot help much, but engineers
  % are appropriate.

%\item \TODO{please expand!}
\item Sharing best practices and tools between sister projects (GAP, ...)
\end{itemize}

%\TODO{lmonade has very similar objectives but uses the gentoo prefix whereas Linux distributions use very different packaging systems:
%\begin{itemize}
%\item gentoo prefix (gentoo)
%\item pacman (arch),
%\item yum (redhat),
%\item apt (debian),
%\item easy\_install
%\item Python index packaging (pip)
%\end{itemize}}

\subsection{Modularization of the Sage distribution}
Separation of the different components of Sage (communication with
third-party softwares, build system, Sage native code). This is a
prerequisite for easier packaging and integration in standard Linux
distributions and lmonade, native integration within the IPython
notebook and other interfaces (larchenv, Spyder, ...) and
collaboration with sister projects.

\subsection{Deployment}
\begin{itemize}
\item Better Windows support
\item Live USB keys
\item Creation, deployment, and distribution of preconfigured virtual
machines for Sage as a cloud service, in particular within the
StratusLab infrastructure.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Interfaces with other computation systems}

\begin{itemize}
\item Support for \href{http://www.symbolic-computing.org/}{SCSCP}
%\item \TODO{expand}
\item foster collaboration with upstream libraries by sharing the
  development and maintenance of the interfaces (typically as
  standalone Python bindings)
\end{itemize}


\subsection{Community animation and training}

\begin{itemize}
\item Sage Days (training workshops and developers meetings)
  \begin{itemize}
  \item \TODO{<put suggestions of locations / dates here>}
  \end{itemize}
\item Exchange visits for students, researchers, ... in between
  partner institutions, and with developers worldwide
\item Strengthening of collaborations with sister projects: GAP,
  Linbox, Singular, PARI/GP, IPython, Scientific Python, R, to name but a
  few.
\item \TODO{please expand}
\end{itemize}



\subsection{Math features}

\begin{itemize}
\item Foundation work: categories, morphisms, coercion, ...
\item Generic parallelism tools for combinatorics
\item Representation theory of monoids and algebras
\item Ore algebras and applications to combinatorics
\item Further development of combinatorial species
\item Automatons and combinatorics on words
  % Interface with Vaucanson, ...
  % https://github.com/coulbois/sage-train-track
  % https://www.lrde.epita.fr/wiki/Vaucanson
  % More support for group theory (especially free group automorphisms, mapping class group of surfaces, braid groups)
\item Symbolic dynamical systems (substitutive systems, Bratelli diagrams,
  sofic shifts, tilings, interval exchange transformations)
\item Manifolds (symbolic computations in charts, differential equations, etc)
  % http://sagemanifolds.obspm.fr/
\item Intersection theory in algebraic geometry
  % http://www.math.sciences.univ-nantes.fr/~sorger/chow_en.html
\item Complexes of modules, resolutions.
\item Graded commutative differential algebras and applications to rational homotopy.
\item Standard bases for modules over path algebras
\item Modular cohomology and Ext algebras for basic algebras
  % going beyond the optional spkg http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/SimonKing/Cohomology/
\item ...
%\item \TODO{please expand!}
\end{itemize}

\begin{itemize}
 \item Transparent integration of Ipython capabilities for cluster computing.
 \item Customization of blas/lapack implementation to take advantage of GPU computing.
 \item Implementation of a transparent abstraction over mpi.
