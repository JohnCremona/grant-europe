% maths at the core of technology and innovation
We live in an innovation-driven society. The key enabling tool for our
advances is mathematics. For just a few examples, the global
positioning system (GPS) needs relativistic mathematics, Computer
Assisted Tomography (CAT scanning) in health care is based on solving
mathematical inverse problems, mobile phone connectivity depends on
combinatorial optimization algorithms, while the modern communications
infrastructure relies on cryptographic algorithms derived from number
theory. At the core of each of these innovations there is the
underpinning mathematics that is implemented through algorithms. Such
innovations have been made possible by investments into pure and
applied mathematics research. Engineering, Science and business
innovation than enrich society and menkind are based on these
mathematical foundations.

% what is this proposal about - aim
In this project, we will provide mathematicians and scientists with a
generic unified toolkit, the Open Digital Research Environment Toolkit
for the Advancement of Mathematics (\TheProject), that allows
(i)~building of specific Virtual Research Environments and (ii)
effective communication of research.

% How
We will achieve this through (i) unification of tool sets, (ii)
engaging with existing and future community efforts through open
source models, (iii) exploitation of recent code collaboration and
technology such as github.

% Why now

% Why is this now possible?
While it is ambitious to create a toolkit for all purposes of
computational mathematics and science, we believe that we are at a
critical point in computational research providing such an
opportunity: (i) Computational software, such as Sage, an open source
mathematics software system, and Jupyter, a browser-based notebook
with support for code, text, mathematical expressions, inline plots
and other media, are revolutionising the way computational research is conducted. (ii) 

Not one tool for all, but component 


It will ensure that ideas are distributed and discussed as
widely as possible to enable rapid assimilation of these ideas into
the pipeline of innovation. Our aim is to develop an ecosystem that
exploits the modern computing infrastructure to streamline development
and deployment of mathematical advances. We will ensure that the
societal benefit of these advances is realized in the shortest
possible timescale.
