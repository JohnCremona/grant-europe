Open Digital Research Environment Toolkit for the Advancement of Mathematics
============================================================================

OpenDreamKit is a European H2020 proposal that we submitted on the
14th of January of 2015. If it gets accepted, it will run for four
years, starting in September of 2015.

For details, see the `proposal <proposal-www.pdf?raw=True>`_. It was
written collaboratively by a diverse team across Europe and
science. Have fun watching this `video
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kM9zcfRtOqo>`_, produced with Gource,
of the activity on our collaborative work space on github. A
pretty good illustration -- especially during the final sprint -- of
how a dispersed but dedicated team can collaborate efficiently with
modern tools!
