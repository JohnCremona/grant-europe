\eucommentary{-- Describe the advance your proposal would provide beyond the
state-of-the-art, and the extent the proposed work is ambitious. Your answer
could refer to the ground-breaking nature of the objectives, concepts
involved, issues and problems to be addressed, and approaches and methods to be used.\\
-- Describe the innovation potential which the proposal represents. Where relevant, refer to
products and services already available, e.g. in existing e-Infrastructures.}

\subsubsection{Specificities of mathematics}

Specific situation of maths w.r.t. Data:
  \begin{itemize}
  \item More often than not data is the result of a computation (and
    not e.g.  an experiment). The role of databases is thus primarily
    to store results for later reuse (persistent caching), and enable
    searches. Because of this, many issues (semantic, ontologies,
    reproducibility, ...) are to be treated upstream at the level of
    software rather than data.
  \item extreme reification in mathematics makes classical ontologies techniques/RDF impractical
  \item interlinking very high
  \item several alternate and defining description of same objects
  \end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Challenges}

Collaboration at the level of large communities.

Promoting collaboration over competition between communities.
