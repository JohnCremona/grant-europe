The Mathematics Institute at the University of Warwick was ranked 23rd
worldwide in the 2013 QS world university subject rankings.  In 2014
one of its members, Regius Professor Martin Hairer, was awarded a
Fields Medal.  The Number Theory research group at Warwick was started
only in 2006, but has rapidly risen to international status and one of
the largest and most vibrant groups in Europe, comprising 25 members
(professors, lecturers, postdoctoral researchers and early stage
researchers).  Mathematics and Statistics at Warwick currently hold
£35.8M in research grants from EPSRC (the next highest in the UK being
Cambridge at £22.8M and Oxford at £24.2M).  [ERC?  at least one, check
  for more.]

In 2013 Professors John Cremona and Samir Siksek, together with
co-investigators at Bristol, were awarded a six-year major grant of
£2.2M from the UK Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council
(EPSRC) to support the L-functions and Modular Forms Database (LMFDB)
project.  This grant funds three postdoctoral researchers at Warwick,
computer equipment to host its database and website, and regular LMFDB
workshops.  Several members of the Number Theory group at Warwick are
developers for Sage, notably John Cremona who has contributed
thousands of lines of code to Sage since 2006 both through his {\tt
  eclib} C++ library and through original \Python code which forms part
of the \Sage library.

Each year Warwick hosts a year-long Warwick EPSRC Symposium focussing
on one area of mathematical research.  The 2012-13 Number Theory
Symposium included six research workshops and a summer school ``Number
Theory for Cryptography'' and raised the international profile of the
number theory group substantially.

\subsubsection*{Significant infrastructure}

Computing infrastructure available to the group is excellent, with
seven dedicated machines (over 300 cores) as well as access through
Warwick's Centre for Scientific Computing which hosts a 6000-core
linux cluster and a 3500-core cluster of workstations.
