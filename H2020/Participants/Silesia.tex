The University of Silesia in Katowice was established in 1968. Now,
with 12 faculties and several interdisciplinary schools and centres,
over 30000 students and over 2000 academic staff the University is one
of the largest in Poland. Students are educated at three educational
levels: Bachelor, Master and Doctoral and their achievement are
accumulated using European Credit Transfer and Accumulation System
(ECTS). Located in the heart of Upper Silesia, Poland's old industrial
region with distinct history and cultural identity, the university
attracts many scientists and students.

The origins of the {\em Faculty of Mathematics, Fhysics and Chemistry} date
back to the academic year 1968/1969 and coincide with the
establishment of the University of Silesia. One of the largest
university units, the faculty incorporates, as its name indicates,
three separate departments: mathematics, physics and chemistry, each
with several divisions and subdivisions carrying out the research and
educational activities. There are over 1900 students, both full-time
and part-time, educated at three educational levels: Bachelor`s,
Master`s and Doctoral. The Faculty is entitled to grant doctoral
degrees in the natural sciences. The Faculty staff consists of 243
academics who are both teachers and researchers.

\subsubsection*{Previous projects or activities}

Internationalisation of research and education is one of the priority
directions of development of the University of Silesia. The University
scientists are actively engaged in research at the international
level, actively participates in European Commission initiatives
focused both on educational and scientific development, and implements
projects within the LLP/Erasmus+ programme, the Research Fund for Coal
and Steel, Framework Programmes, as well as the EU Structural Funds.

The institution has been involved in more than 40 FP7 proposals, of
which 15 have been funded.

The Faculty of Mathematics, Physics and Chemistry was involved in the
implementation of several FP6 and FP7 projects:
\begin{compactenum}
\item HadronPhysics (RII3/CT/2003/506078)
\item FlaviaNet (MRTN-CT-2006-035482)
\item LAGUNA (212343)
\item LHCPhenoNet (612536). 
\end{compactenum}

There are following projects which are directly connected to
infrastructures for virtual research environments:

\begin{compactenum}
\item 2011-2014 - iCSE (innovative Computing in Science Education) -
  \euro 1m grant from European Social Fund, incorporating
  computational perspective in teaching of mathematics, physics and
  chemistry using cloud based \Sage system and \Python language.
\item 2014-30.11.2015 PAAD (Platform for data analysis and archiving) 
\euro 3.8m, funded is mostly HPC centre for research with
  interactive access based on web based notebook UI.
\item 2014-30.11.2015 CNS: Centre of Applied Science - 2nd stage,
  Infrastructure grant includes \euro 0.5m funding for small HPC and
  cloud infrastructure for education. Technically this will be
  extension of research HPC centre for educational purposes.
\end{compactenum}



\subsubsection*{Significant infrastructure}

The University of Silesia has finished or currently implements ESF grants
totalling to about \euro 120m for infrastructure, laboratories and
computing centres. New HPC centres are under construction (PAAD and
CNS projects) which will provide necessary hardware for development
and implementation of virtual research environments.
