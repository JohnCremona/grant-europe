    \item[\texttt{Pythran}:] \TOWRITE{PB}{...}
 \item[\texttt{fflas-ffpack}:] An open-source \texttt{C++} library offering dense
    linear algebra kernels over a finite field. In the same  spirit as the
    numerical \texttt{BLAS} (Basic Linear Algebra Subroutines), and
    \texttt{LAPACK} libraries, it delivers high performance for the most
    commonly used routines of scientific computing: matrix multiplication,
    solving linear systems, computing echelon forms, determinants,
    characteristic polynomials, etc. This library has set the standard
    approach for high performance exact dense linear algebra. It is currently
    used in \texttt{Sage}, and has inspired the design of similar routines in
    most commercial computer algebra softwares: \texttt{maple}, \texttt{magma}, etc.
  \item[\texttt{LinBox}:] An open-source \texttt{C++} middleware library for
    exact linear algebra. It uses \texttt{fflas-ffpack} for its dense finite
    field linear algebra part and extends its functionalities to other
    computation domains (integers, rationals, polynomial rings) and type
    matrices (sparse and structures matrices, black-box
    matrices). \texttt{LinBox} is integrated in \texttt{Sage}.
