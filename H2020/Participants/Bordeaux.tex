Bordeaux is an important center of studies and research in France
with approximately 50,000 students, 2,000 PhD students and 5,000
researchers. The University of Bordeaux was founded in the XVth
century and nowadays the city regroups two universities, dozens of
schools as well as \TOWRITE{VD}{NUMBER} research laboratories with partner institution such
as CNRS, Inserm, INRA and INRIA.

The Institut Math\'emathiques de Bordeaux (IMB) is a leading
institution in Number Theory. It is the home of the software
\PariGP and the Journal de Th\'eorie des Nombres de Bordeaux.

The city of Bordeaux also hosts two important young laboraties
for computer science: Laboratoire Bordelais d'Informatique (LaBRI)
and INRIA-Bordeaux.

\medskip
In the context of this proposal, Bordeaux has a long standing experience in
Algorithmic Number Theory and two significant hardware infrastructures
(Plafrim and Avakas). The CNRS Aquitaine main task in this project is the
extension of \PariGP in relation with the other software components and
the .

\subsubsection*{Curriculum vitae}
Note that for purely administrative reasons, Loic Gouarin will be rattached to
CNRS Aquitaine but is naturally based at Paris sud.

\subsubsection*{Previous projects or activities}

Current grants:
\begin{enumerate}
\item
 ANR PEACE (2012-2015)
    Goal: The discrete logarithm problem on algebraic curves is one of the rare
    contact points between deep theoretical questions in arithmetic geometry and
    every day applications. On the one side it involves a better understanding,
    from an effective point of view, of moduli space of curves, of abelian
    varieties, the maps that link these spaces and the objects they classify.
    On the other side, new and efficient algorithms to compute the discrete
    logarithm problem would have dramatic consequences on the security and
    efficiency of already deployed cryptographic devices. 

\item
ERC starting grant ANTICS (2011-2016) 
    Goal: "Rebuild algorithmic number theory on the firm grounds of theoretical
    computer science".
    Challenges: complexity (how fast can an algorithm be?), reliability
    (how correct should an algorithm be?), parallelisation.
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection*{Significant infrastructure}
\begin{enumerate}
\item The Plafrim is a regional federation hosted at INRIA Bordeaux (in partnership with the LaBRI and IMB). It has an important cluster devoted to experimental code (1188 cores).
\item The M\'esocenter de Calcul Intensif Aquitain (MCIA) is localized
in Bordeaux. It hosts the Avakas cluster (3328 cores,  38 TFlops) and the
M3PEC cluster (432 cores).

- [ ] checked that sum of person months put into finance request is
  the same as sum of person months associated with the Work Packages
  (in proposal.tex, as defined as part of the \begin{workpackage}"
  command.
  
  Take into account person months associated with work package 1, time
  of all staff to be hired and work on the project (including
  investigators). Figure 5 helps with a quick check of the sums over
  different work packages.

- [X] completed site specific resource summary in resources.tex,
  including table of non-staff costs. This is compulsory (EU
  regulations) if the non-staff cost exceed 15% of the total cost, and
  is likely to be the case for most of the partners. We ask everybody
  to do it, to be consistent and show transparently how we have
  planned our total budget.

- [X] Have all our tasks a designated lead institution? Check in the
  Work Packages that all the tasks you are involved in have a
  dedicated lead party. If the lead party is "USO", then use:
  \begin{task}[lead=USO]

- [X] Have all our deliverables a designated lead institution [using
  the 'lead=' key]?

- [ ] In the "Members of the consortium section", have we addressed "a
  description of the legal entity and its main tasks, with an
  explanation of how its profile matches the tasks in the
  proposal"? See Entry for Paris Sud and Southampton as examples.

- [ ] In the Members of the consortium section, have we given
  descriptions of all the people we intend to hire (even if we don't
  know who that is yet). 
  
- [ ] Do all our tasks include us in the list of sites involved?
