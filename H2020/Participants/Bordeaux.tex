The Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (National Centre for
Scientific Research, CNRS) is a public organization under the responsibility of
the French Ministry of Education and Research. Its missions are
\begin{compactitem}
\item To evaluate and carry out research and
bringing social, cultural, and economic benefits for society.
\item To contribute to the application and promotion of research results.
\item To develop scientific information.
\item To support research training.
\item To participate in the analysis of the national and international
scientific climate in order to develop a
national policy.
\end{compactitem}
It consists of ten institutes in Biology, Humanities, Information Sciences and
Technologies, etc. CNRS laboratories (or research units) are located throughout
France, and employ a large body of tenured researchers, engineers, and support
staff.

Three research units are concerned by this proposal. The Laboratoire
Math\'ematiques d'Orsay (LMO) which is a Joint Research Unit with Universit\'e Paris-Sud
which is a partner of this proposal and has already been described
(see~\ref{desc:ParisSud}). Two laboratories in Bordeaux (FR), the Laboratoire
d'Informatique Bordelais (LaBRI) and the Institut Math\'ematiques de
Bordeaux (IMB). Those two units are joint with the Universit\'e de
Bordeaux which is a Third Party Linked to CNRS of this proposal
(see~\ref{section:ThirdParties}).

The Institut Math\'emathiques de Bordeaux (IMB) is a leading
institution in Number Theory. It is the home of the software
\PariGP and the Journal de Th\'eorie des Nombres de Bordeaux.

The city of Bordeaux also hosts two important young laboratories
for computer science: Laboratoire Bordelais d'Informatique (LaBRI)
and INRIA-Bordeaux. The former is a leader in Europe for analytic
combinatorics.

\medskip
In the context of this proposal, Bordeaux has a long standing experience in
Algorithmic Number Theory and two significant hardware infrastructures
(Plafrim and Avakas).

The Bordeaux site will lead the development of \PariGP within
workpackages \WPref{UI},\WPref{hpc}, \WPref{dissem} and will play
a major role in \WPref{hpc} with respect to combinatorics in partnership with Paris-Sud.
It will also organise workshops in favour of developing countries (\WPref{dissem}).

\subsubsection*{Previous projects or activities}

Current grants:
\begin{compactenum}
\item
 ANR PEACE (2012-2015).
    Goal: The discrete logarithm problem on algebraic curves is one of the rare
    contact points between deep theoretical questions in arithmetic geometry and
    every day applications. On the one side it involves a better understanding,
    from an effective point of view, of moduli space of curves, of abelian
    varieties, the maps that link these spaces and the objects they classify.
    On the other side, new and efficient algorithms to compute the discrete
    logarithm problem would have dramatic consequences on the security and
    efficiency of already deployed cryptographic devices. 

\item
ERC starting grant ANTICS (2011-2016).
    Goal: "Rebuild algorithmic number theory on the firm grounds of theoretical
    computer science".
    Challenges: complexity (how fast can an algorithm be?), reliability
    (how correct should an algorithm be?), parallelisation.
\end{compactenum}

\subsubsection*{Significant infrastructure}
\begin{compactenum}
\item The Plafrim is a regional federation hosted at INRIA Bordeaux (in partnership with the LaBRI and IMB). It has an important cluster devoted to experimental code (1188 cores).
\item The M\'esocenter de Calcul Intensif Aquitain (MCIA) is localised
in Bordeaux. It hosts the Avakas cluster (3328 cores,  38 TFlops) and the
M3PEC cluster (432 cores).
