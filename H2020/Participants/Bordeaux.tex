Bordeaux is an important center of studies and research in France
with approximately 50,000 students, 2,000 PhD students and 5,000
researchers. The University of Bordeaux was founded in the 15th
century and nowadays the city regroups two universities, dozens of
schools and 100 research laboratories with partner institution such
as CNRS, Inserm, INRA and INRIA.

The Institut Math\'emathiques de Bordeaux (IMB) is a leading
institution in Number Theory. It is the home of the software
\PariGP and the Journal de Th\'eorie des Nombres de Bordeaux.

The city of Bordeaux also hosts two important young laboratories
for computer science: Laboratoire Bordelais d'Informatique (LaBRI)
and INRIA-Bordeaux.

\medskip
In the context of this proposal, Bordeaux has a long standing experience in
Algorithmic Number Theory and two significant hardware infrastructures
(Plafrim and Avakas). The main task of Bordeaux in this project is the
extension of \PariGP in relation with the other software components and
the .

The Bordeaux site will lead the development of \PariGP within
workpackages \WPref{UI},\WPref{hpc}, \WPref{dissem}. It will also play
an important role in \WPref{hpc} with respect to combinatorics
and the organisation of workshop in favour of developing countries in \WPref{dissem}.

\subsubsection*{Previous projects or activities}

Current grants:
\begin{compactenum}
\item
 ANR PEACE (2012-2015).
    Goal: The discrete logarithm problem on algebraic curves is one of the rare
    contact points between deep theoretical questions in arithmetic geometry and
    every day applications. On the one side it involves a better understanding,
    from an effective point of view, of moduli space of curves, of abelian
    varieties, the maps that link these spaces and the objects they classify.
    On the other side, new and efficient algorithms to compute the discrete
    logarithm problem would have dramatic consequences on the security and
    efficiency of already deployed cryptographic devices. 

\item
ERC starting grant ANTICS (2011-2016).
    Goal: "Rebuild algorithmic number theory on the firm grounds of theoretical
    computer science".
    Challenges: complexity (how fast can an algorithm be?), reliability
    (how correct should an algorithm be?), parallelisation.
\end{compactenum}

\subsubsection*{Significant infrastructure}
\begin{compactenum}
\item The Plafrim is a regional federation hosted at INRIA Bordeaux (in partnership with the LaBRI and IMB). It has an important cluster devoted to experimental code (1188 cores).
\item The M\'esocenter de Calcul Intensif Aquitain (MCIA) is localised
in Bordeaux. It hosts the Avakas cluster (3328 cores,  38 TFlops) and the
M3PEC cluster (432 cores).
