% See proposal.tex, Members of the Consortium for a complete description of what should go there
The University of Kaiserslautern (UK) is a medium sized university founded in 1970. It currently 
consists of 12 departments, ranging from mathematics and business studies and economics, 
computer sciences and electrical and computer technology over mechanical and process engineering, 
biology, chemistry and physics to architecture, regional and environmental planning, and social sciences. 
The university has 13,725 students, 3636 of whom are remote study students. The scientific location 
of Kaiserslautern is also distinguished by the presence of multiple external research institutes of 
considerable reputation, including two facilities of the Fraunhofer network and the German Research 
Institution for Artificial Intelligence. All these institutions maintain close links and even share staff 
with the corresponding departments of UK, which is chairing the Science Alliance Kaiserslautern, 
a network of these research institutions. The university conducts a number of international 
collaborations and successfully participated in projects funded under several EU Framework 
Programs and has gathered comprehensive experience both as coordinator and partner in research 
networks and projects. Besides projects with national funding, the UK is 
also very active in the field of international research. In this context, the funding instruments 
available in the EU Framework Programmes play an important role. In total, the UK is partner 
to a total of 11 projects (as of January 2015) conducted under the 7th FP and Horizon 2020. 
Nine further individual projects funded by ERC (2) or Marie-Curie measures (7) are being co-ordinated 
by researchers at UK. By this involvement to date, UK has procured more than 13 million Euros under the 7th FP.

\medskip In the context of this proposal, the
\emph{Algebra, Geometry, and Computer Algebra Group}  of the Department
of Mathematics at UK is widely known for its long tradition in 
computational algebraic geometry and algebra, with particular emphasis on the 
development of the computer algebra system \Singular and its satellites and  
subsystems such as \software{Factory}, \software{PolyBori}, and \software{Plural}.
Kaiserslautern's main tasks in this project are to add very fine-grained 
parallelism to some key components of \Singular and to work
on the maintenance and improvement of \MPIR, whose lead developer,
William Heart, is working at UK.

\begin{participant}[type=res,PM=48]{NN}
We will hire a full time experienced software developer to work
  under the leadership of Wolfram Decker on adding very fine-grained 
  parallelism to some key components of \Singular. The fellow
  will have past experience of parallelism in software development.
  We further require good communication and team working
  skills.
\end{participant}

\begin{participant}[type=res,PM=12]{NN}
  We will hire a full time highly specialised software developer and
  assembly expert, to work under the leadership of Wolfram Decker on the
  performance task \taskref{hpc}{hpc-mpir} for \MPIR.
