The University of Sheffield is a leading Reasearch University in the
United Kingdom that was ranked 69th in the World in the most recent
2014 QS World University Rankings and was ranked in the top ten for
the most recent UK wide research asssment exercise.  Professor
Lawrence is based in The Sheffield Institute for Translational
Neuroscience (SITraN) and the Department of Computer Science at the
University of Sheffield have a unique partnership based on two shared
professorial appointments, Professor Winston Hide and Professor Neil
Lawrence.  SITraN is a world leading research centre for
neurodegenerative disease, located in a purpose built building on the
University of Sheffield campus adjacent to the Medical School at
Sheffield Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust Royal Hallamshire Hospital. 

The Department of Computer Science was ranked 5th across UK
departments in ``Research Quality'' by the recent UK-wide Research
Evaluation Framework. It has a particular history of working with data
with internationally leading groups in Machine Learning, Speech and
Language Processing.

\subsubsection*{Previous projects or activities}

\begin{enumerate}
\item Organisers of the Gaussian Process Summer Schools (three 3-day workshops on Gaussian process models in python and the IPython notebook).
\item Organisers of five Gaussian Process and Data Science Road Shows (educating on data science and Gaussian process models in Uganda, Colombia, Italy, Australia and Kenya) Each workshop is 3-4 days long. 
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection*{Significant infrastructure}
\begin{enumerate}
\item The Sheffield Institute for Translational Neuroscience is a 18 million pound world leading institute for research into neurodegenerative disorders. It houses clinicians, biologists and computationalists under a single roof and contains the Sheffield Microarray and Next Generation sequencing Core Facility. The institute provides an exemplar of how mathematical ideas can be rapidly translated to analysis through provision of appropriate software frameworks.
