The University of St Andrews is the third-oldest in the
English-speaking world (founded 1413) and pursues cutting edge
research in all its academic Schools and interdisciplinary Institutes
and Centres supported by a wide range of grants from many sources. 
The University currently has about 8000 students and 600
academic staff in 19 Schools.

The Centre for Interdisciplinary Research in Computational Algebra (CIRCA)
fosters research at the interface of Mathematics and Computer Science including
abstract and algorithmic algebra and combinatorics, formal languages and
automata, mathematical software and constraint programming. Our success is 
founded on the close integration of theoretical and algorithmic research and 
the development and use of state-of-the-art software. CIRCA includes
36 staff and 20 research students.

In 1997, CIRCA became the centre of the development of \GAP after the 
retirement of Prof.~J. Neub\"user who initiated the system in 
mid-1980s in Aachen. This move was supported by EPSRC, EU and Leverhulme 
grants. Now \GAP and its packages comprise over 1 million lines of C and 
1.25 million lines of \GAP code. The system is distributed freely under the GPL,
and our records show that it has been installed in at least 3000 sites and 
cited in several thousand publications 
(see \url{http://bit.ly/gap_citations} and \url{http://www.gap-system.org/Doc/Bib/bib.html} ). 
\GAP was used in landmark computations such as the ``Millennium Project'' 
to classify all groups of order up to 2000 
and the classification of the over $10^{19}$ semigroups of order 10. It is 
designed to be natural to use for mathematicians; to be powerful and flexible 
for experts and to be freely extensible so that it can encompass new mathematics. 
These objectives have been met and \GAP was awarded the ACM/SIGSAM Richard D. Jenks
Memorial Prize for Excellence in Software Engineering applied to Computer Algebra in 2008.

Nowadays, as one of the centres of \GAP\ development, CIRCA has
excellent contacts with developers and users worldwide. Particularly 
relevant to this proposal are the Singular and homalg groups at 
Kaiserslautern, Soicher at QMUL, Praeger and others at UWA, Cooperman 
and his students at NEU and the other \GAP centres in Aachen and Fort Collins.

CIRCA publishes highly-regarded research in Pure Mathematics and in
Computer Science, recognised by our highly-cited publications in top
international venues in both disciplines. A particular speciality is
research that integrates the two disciplines very closely, for
instance the study of decidability problems in algebraic structures
defined using formal language theory. Beyond the individual international connections of the 
investigators and research staff, CIRCA as a centre has national 
importance and international standing. CIRCA has been selected to host 
major conferences such as CP 2010, BCC 2009, PP 2007, and the 
``Groups St Andrews'' series in 2005 and 2013.

\begin{compactenum}
\item
\textbf{Multidisciplinary Critical Mass in Computational
Algebra and Applications} EP/C523229 2005--2010, \pounds 1.1m.
Through a range of subprojects this grant developed CIRCA as 
a broad centre of excellence in computational algebra. We 
extended \GAP, developed new algorithms, and opened up new 
applications in AI, combinatorics and physics. The project 
produced over 200 refereed publications in a huge range of 
venues, and delivered, as intended, a sustainable step change 
in the scale and breadth of CIRCA's research.
\item 
\textbf{SCIEnce: Symbolic Computation Infrastructure for Europe}
(FP6 eRII3-CT-026133) 2006--2011, \euro 3.2m, coordinator
(see \ref{linked-projects}).
\item
\textbf{HPCGAP: High Performance Computational Algebra and Discrete Mathematics} 
EP/G055181 2009--2014, \pounds 1.5m, four sites, coordinator (see \ref{linked-projects}).

\subsubsection*{Significant infrastructure}

CIRCA provides hosting for the \GAP website and ftp-servers, runs the 
continuous integration systems used by \GAP and its large collection
of  packages, and manages \GAP release preparation. We have a
substantial pool of multicore compute servers.

- [X] checked that sum of person months put into finance request is
  the same as sum of person months associated with the Work Packages
  (in proposal.tex, as defined as part of the \begin{workpackage}"
  command.
  
  Take into account person months associated with work package 1, time
  of all staff to be hired and work on the project (including
  investigators). Figure 5 helps with a quick check of the sums over
  different work packages.

- [X] completed site specific resource summary in resources.tex,
  including table of non-staff costs. This is compulsory (EU
  regulations) if the non-staff cost exceed 15% of the total cost, and
  is likely to be the case for most of the partners. We ask everybody
  to do it, to be consistent and show transparently how we have
  planned our total budget.

- [X] Have all our tasks a designated lead institution? Check in the
  Work Packages that all the tasks you are involved in have a
  dedicated lead party. If the lead party is "USO", then use:
  \begin{task}[lead=USO]

     SL: all done excepot possibly for Social Aspects


- [X] Have all our deliverables a designated lead institution [using
  the 'lead=' key]?

- [X] In the "Members of the consortium section", have we addressed "a
  description of the legal entity and its main tasks, with an
  explanation of how its profile matches the tasks in the
  proposal"? See Entry for Paris Sud and Southampton as examples.
  
- [X] In the Members of the consortium section, have we given
  descriptions of all the people we intend to hire (even if we don't
  know who that is yet). 
  
- [ ] Do all our tasks include us in the list of sites involved?
