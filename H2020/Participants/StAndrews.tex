The Centre for Interdisciplinary Research in Computational Algebra (CIRCA)
fosters research at the interface of Mathematics and Computer Science including
abstract and algorithmic algebra and combinatorics, formal languages and
automata, mathematical software and constraint programming. Our success is 
founded on the close integration of theoretical and algorithmic research and 
the development and use of state-of-the-art software.

CIRCA's output includes first class results in Pure Mathematics and in
Computer Science, recognised by our highly-cited publications in top
international venues in both disciplines and our widely used research
software. Beyond the individual international connections of the 
investigators and research staff, CIRCA as a centre has national 
importance and international standing. CIRCA has been selected to host 
major conferences such as CP 2010, BCC 2009, PP 2007, and the 
``Groups St Andrews'' series in 2005 and 2013.
