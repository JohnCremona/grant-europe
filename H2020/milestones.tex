The work in the \TheProject project is structured by four milestones,
which coincide with the four project meetings held at the end of each
year of the project (the other four meetings will be held in the middle
of each year). Given the nature of the project, with a
large number of essentially independent tasks, there is no need for
milestones attached to specific collections of tasks or
deliverables. Instead, given that the meetings are the main
face-to-face interaction points in the project, it's suitable to
schedule the milestones for these events, where they can be discussed
in detail, tracking the progress in each work package through status
reports on the tasks and deliverables.

We envisage that this setup will give the project the vital coherence
in spite of the broad interdisciplinary mix of various backgrounds of the
participants.
