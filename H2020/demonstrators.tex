Micromagnetics is a continuum theory description of the behaviour of
the magnetisation vector field at length scales of the order of
micrometers and below. It is widely used in the research and
development of magnetic data storage media and devices, for magnetic
sensing, permanent magnets and healthcare applications such as cancer
treatment and diagnostics. The mathematical model is a time dependent
nonlinear partial differential equation with multiple length and time
scales in the problem, and solution strategies are based on finite
difference and finite element space discretisations and sophisticated
numerical solution of the equations. As in many other research fields,
the groups carrying out the simulations are often not the code
developers, nor have they extensive computational background. More
commonly, these are material scientists, engineers and physicists that
use the simulation to interpret their experiments and support their
device design planning. Industrial users include Seagate, Hitachi,
TDK, Samsung, Bosch and Toyota.

Figure~\ref{fig:3d-plots} shows magnetisation vector fields obtained
in typical micromagnetic studies. They relate, from left to
right, to a set of interacting magnetic skyrmions in a thin flim, a
vortex in a thin Nickel film, a vortex in a half-sphere geometry, and
the propagation of magnetic excitations (only one component plotted)
in a 1d-system.

In this project, we will use the \TheProject components to put
together a in micromagnetic VRE to (i) demonstrate the power of the
approach in a concrete applied research setting, (ii) exploit that
experience to evaluate the real value of the structure of this VRE and
\TheProject to a large and diverse set of end-users.

In more detail, we will embed the most popular micromagnetic
simulation software: the Object Oriented MicroMagnetic Framework
\cite{OOMMF-url} within a micromagnetic VRE, complement this with
value-adding features, develop a substantial number of executable
documents inside this VRE that act as tutorials and documentation,
disseminate the software and documents as open source and through
workshops for the micromagnetic community.  We have chosen the OOMMF
simulation package as the target tool because is widely used (over
1800 recorded publications \cite{OOMMF-citations-url}) and thus
provides benefit to a substantial community and will provide plenty of
feedback.

We evaluate the value of this demonstrator
(\taskref{social-aspects}{oommf-nb-evaluation}), immediately feeding
results back into the \TheProject work. This will also
be a case study for the sustainability of the approach and tool beyond
the life time of this H2020 project.
