TODO list for Hans

The following check lists are to be added to the proposal 

\begin{draft}

\TOWRITE{INITIALS}{}

Check list for every partner: Tick off the items that are done.

- [ ] checked that sum of person months put into finance request is
  the same as sum of person months associated with the Work Packages
  (in proposal.tex, as defined as part of the "\begin{workpackage}"
  command.
  
  Take into account person months associated with work package 1, time
  of all staff to be hired and work on the project (including
  investigators). Figure 5 helps with a quick check of the sums over
  different work packages.

- [ ] completed site specific resource summary in resources.tex,
  including table of non-staff costs. This is compulsory (EU
  regulations) if the non-staff cost exceed 15% of the total cost, and
  is likely to be the case for most of the partners. We ask everybody
  to do it, to be consistent and show transparently how we have
  planned our total budget.

- [ ] Have all our tasks a designated lead institution? Check in the
  Work Packages that all the tasks you are involved in have a
  dedicated lead party. If the lead party is "USO", then use:
  \begin{task}[lead=USO]

- [ ] Have all our deliverables a designated lead institution [using
  the 'lead=' key]?


- [ ] In the "Members of the consortium section", have we addressed "a
  description of the legal entity and its main tasks, with an
  explanation of how its profile matches the tasks in the
  proposal"? See Entry for Paris Sud and Southampton as examples.

- [ ] In the Members of the consortium section, have we given
  descriptions of all the people we intend to hire (even if we don't
  know who that is yet). 

\end{draft}

For WP coordinators: have all the tasks and deliverables in the WP a lead institution?



Check list for opening statements, objectives, summaries:

- [ ] Go through the one relevant page (page 4) of the assessment
forms
(http://ec.europa.eu/research/participants/data/ref/h2020/other/call_ptef/ef/h2020-call-ef-ria_einfra_en.pdf
) and see how we address these points.

- [ ] Re-read
  https://ec.europa.eu/research/participants/portal/desktop/en/opportunities/h2020/topics/2144-einfra-9-2015.html#tab2
  for context setting and what we are trying to address

- [ ] Also summary in comments that show on page 2 of the pdf file if
  compiled with draft comments showing.





- move T7 to component architecturs?

- T8 can be declared to depend on T7

- [ ] T7 make shorter

- [ ] T9, move generic statements about benefits of executable into
  the description, make T9 shorter. T9 becomes a demonstrator for
  this, and for the extensibility and usefulness of Jupyter.

- [ ] call T10 demonstrator for virtual environments. Demonstrator:
  Downloadable and executable virtual for micromagnetic simulation.

- [ ] rename OOMMF to 'micromagnetic simulation' where appropriate.

In WP User interfaces: T1 -> Nicolas, T2-> Min, T3 -> Min, T4 ->
Nicolas, T5 -> Nicolas [logilab], T6 -> Jupyter/Logilab, Michael,
latex, rephrase as reconciling technologies, T11 -> Martin is leading
it, ensight/logilab, T12 -> Michael.
