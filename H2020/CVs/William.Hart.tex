\begin{participant}[type=PI,gender=male]{Dr. William Hart}

William Hart is a postdoctoral researcher at the University of
Kaiserslautern. He is the lead developer of the 
\software{Flint} and \software{MPIR} projects
as well as the main author and maintainer of the \software{BSDNT} bignum library, the
\software{Nemo} and \software{ANTIC} libraries and a contributor to various 
other software packages.

Before coming to Kaiserslautern, held a prestigious five year Career
Acceleration Fellowship ``Algorithms in Algebraic Number Theory'' at Warwick
University in the UK. He has been involved in a number of high performance
computing records, including computation of congruent numbers (subject of the
famous Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer conjecture, one of the Millennium Prize Problems 
listed by the Clay Mathematics Institute) for up to a trillion ($10^{12}$).

William is the main author of the FFT code for multiplication of large integers
and polynomials in both \software{MPIR} and \software{Flint}, which are used 
extensively by the \Sage,
\Singular and \software{Macaulay2} computer algebra systems.

The main focus of William's research has been in algorithms for fast arithmetic, 
fast integer and polynomial factorisation and to algebraic number theory,
including computation of modular equations and class invariants.
