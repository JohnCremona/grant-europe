  We will fund existing post-doctoral research resource to carry out work on implementing \Jupyter on SGE for ease of HPC performance. They will work collaboratively with Neil Lawrence, Mike Croucher and the other Sheffield researcher appointment to achieve this goal. The fellow will have a background in computational science, with experience of HPC and 
  \Jupyter{} Notebook experience. As is normal we will require good communication and team working
  skills.
