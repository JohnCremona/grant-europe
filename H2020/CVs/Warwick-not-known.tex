\begin{participant}[type=R, PM=24]{NN}
  We will hire a computational support technician to work at Warwick,
  under the leadership of Professor John Cremona, on the tasks of Work
  Package 6 (Data/Knowledge/Software-bases).  He or she will develop
  closer integration between \Sage and the \LMFDB, as a prototype for
  similar integration between mathematical software and databases.  He
  or she will have a background in computational science, with
  experience of software engineering, including front-end web
  development (HTML5, CSS), will be proficient in \Python and
  web-development libraries (\software{flask}, \software{jinja2}), 
  and have knowledge of SQL
  and NoSQL databases (\software{SQLite}, \software{MongoDB}). 
  We further require the person
  to have good communication and team-working skills, to be able to
  communicate technical details to casual programmers and able to
  prioritise and delegate tasks.  Experience with \Sage and other
  mathematical software will be an advantage.
