\begin{participant}[type=R,PM=0,gender=male]{Lo\"ic Gouarin}
  Research Engineer since 2005 at CNRS and more specifically since
  2010 at the Laboratoire de Mathématique d'Orsay, Université
  Paris-Sud, Loïc Gouarin develops scientific computing software in
  different fields like Lattice-Boltzmann methods, Stokes solvers for
  fluid particles interaction, ...

  He is also director of the ``GdR Calcul'' and co-director of the
  ``Réseau Calcul''. These two entities form the ``Groupe Calcul'' of
  the CNRS whose role is to animate the scientific and high
  performance computing community in France, in particular by
  organising conferences, meetings, and seminars. In this context, he
  organises himself 3 to 4 training and development workshops per
  year, and promotes the use of \Python for teaching and research in
  France.

  Organisationally, due to purely administrative constraints within
  CNRS, Loïc Gouarin will be attached to \site{UB}.
