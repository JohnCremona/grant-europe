is a Senior Research Fellow at the Department of Computer Science
of  the University of Oxford, where he also holds a Lectureship
at Pembroke College. Before moving to Oxford in 2013, he taught mathematics for 8
years in Nanyang Technological University (Singapore). While there, he
was successful in receiving individual grant funding totalling over 500K, 
graduated 2 PhD students, supervised post-doctoral researchers, 
and co-organized a 2-months research program
at Singapore Institute for Mathematical Sciences
on a range of topics in computational mathematics, involving over 100 participants. 

He works on a wide area of interconnected topics, related to computational algebra
and optimization, combinatorics, algorithm, symbolic computing, and game theory, and authored over
70 papers on these topics, several of them using Sage and/or its components, such as GAP.

He is an active Sage developer, and regularly contributes, himself or together
with his undergraduate or graduate students, new or improved Sage interfaces to
various mathematical packages and databases.
He has good understanding of the overall Sage development process, as well as 
of development of other open-source sofware and databases, including their
social/community aspects.
