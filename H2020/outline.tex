\subsection*{Mission statement for the grant}

Our mission is to promote the next generation of community-developed
open source software, databases, and services adapted to the needs of
collaborative research in pure mathematics and applications.

Our research will cover a wide variety of aspects, ranging from
software development models, user interfaces \TODO{virtual
  environments?}, deployment frameworks and novel collaborative tools,
component architecture, design, and standardization of software
\TODO{system?} and databases, to links to publication, data archival
and reproducibility of experiments, development models and tools, and
social aspects.

It will consolidate Europe's leading position in computational
mathematics and build on the remarkable success of the ecosystem of
projects GAP, Python/Sage, Pari, Singular, LMFDB.
