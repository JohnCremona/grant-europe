Guidance for budgeting travel expenses
======================================

As a consortium, we should request identical amounts of money for all
our activities where this is reasonable, and deviate it from it where
necessary and explainable.

Common activities include

- conference attendance
- project meetings
- coding sprints
- visits at partner sites

Suggested costs for these categories:

Conference attendance: we split these into EU conferences and overseas
(overseas as in 'away from Europe') and suggest

- 2200 EUR for an overseas conference  (assumes 1-week trip)

- 1200 EUR for an EU conference / work shop (assumes 1-week trip)

- 750 EUR for a visit to a EU partner per week, such as for coding
  sprints, one-to-one visits for particular research.

The actual expenses will vary: for example, we expect that it is more
expensive to travel from Oslo (distance) or the UK (island) to
Karlsruhe than it is from France, but once partners from Germany or
France have to travel to Oslo or the UK, they will face similar costs,
and it is good if our numbers look consistent. If this turns out to be
unbalanced, then those with more spare resources can pay, for example,
accommodation for incoming visitors to correct this - in the end we
are all aiming for good science and are likely to help each other out
to achieve this together. For now, we need to maximise the chances of
getting the funding.

Training and developer workshops
--------------------------------

Training workshops are more difficult: they engage different
communities, and will have different requiremens. Some data from the
past Sage days:

The usual, quite successful, format of Sage days is 5 days, 2-3 with
presentations, and the rest just working hard. Or sometimes just 5
days of coding.

Budget for our yearly developers meeting in Orsay: roughly 4k euros
for the local expenses for 12 people, that's about 350EUR per person
to accommodate them and provide food. We achieve this by renting a big
house and cooking ourselves (which also has strong community building
virtues):

To engage others (i.e. non-project members from the community), we can
ask for additional funds. In the pags or traditional Sage days, a
budget of 16k euros for about 40 people, allowed to pay for the travel
and accommodation of some good proportion of the participants, with a
priority on invited people and graduate students, i.e. 400 EUR per
attendee.


Frequency of events
-------------------

Depend a little on purpose. Suggestions are:

One-to-One partner site visits: For every partner, expect 2 visits per
year for one person to other partner sites. (i.e. 2 x 750EUR per
year).

Conference attendance: One overseas and one EU-conference for each
post-doc and one investigator per site per year.

Budgeting for project partners
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

4000 for 12 means 333 per person. That is accommodation and
food. Attendees will need to budget travel expenses themselves in
their project budget. Alternatively, we can budget 750 EUR per
attendee to cover all costs (inline with our numbers for other
activities) to keep things simple.

Budgeting to engage people from outside the project
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Financial support for outreach: For traditional Sage days,
we typically budget 16k euros for about 40 people, which allows to pay
for the travel and accommodation of some good proportion of the
participants, with a priority on invited people and graduate
students. That means we are asking to subsidise attendance of
workshops by 400 EUR per person on average.
