\begin{WPObjectives}
  The objective of this work package is to organize and optimize the
  communication with the larger community. This includes:
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Reviewing emerging technologies
  \item Advertising the project (press, web, ...).
  \item Disseminating results and deliverables.
  \end{itemize}
\end{WPObjectives}

\begin{WPDescription}
  The first task of \theWP{} is to produce periodic reviews of
  emerging technologies and relevant developments elsewhere, and
  implications for our plans. This include the review of standard
  components and service for storage and sharing, computational
  resources, authentication, package management, etc.  This may
  further include negotiating access or shared development when
  appropriate. This information will be fed to the other work
  packages, in particular\TODO{ref: Component Architecture}.

  Dissemination: software, APIs, technologies, research results, ...
\end{WPDescription}

\begin{WPDeliverables}
\begin{itemize}
% Or make those into a single deliverable?
\item \ref{del:periodic-rep-1}
  (Month 12): Year 1 report.
\item \ref{del:periodic-rep-2}
  (Month 24): Year 2 report.
\item \ref{del:periodic-rep-3}
  (Month 36): Year 3 report.
\item \ref{del:periodic-rep-4}
  (Month 48): Year 4 report.
% \deliverable{del:pressrelease} % Press release.
% \deliverable{del:website} % Project presentation (web site). 
% \deliverable{del:workshop1}  % Report on first project workshop, year 1. 
% \deliverable{del:dissemplan1} % Final plan for using and disseminating knowledge.
% \deliverable{del:workshop2}  % Report on second project workshop, year 2
% \deliverable{del:workshop3}  % Report on third project workshop, year 3

Raw material:
\begin{itemize}
\item Documentation improvements: overview, cross links, overview of
  recent improvements
\item Thematic tutorials
\item Collections of pedagogical documents\\
  E.g. a complete collection of interactive class notes with computer
  lab projects for the ``Algèbre et Calcul formel'' option of the
  French math aggregation (starting from 2014-2015, only open-source
  systems will be supported, and Sage is a major player).
  % See http://nicolas.thiery.name/Enseignement/Agregation/ as a starter
  % Math labs with Sage for first year students in France (L1): http://math.univ-lyon1.fr/~omarguin/
\item Localization of the Sage user interface and key documents in
  various European languages.
\item Distribution of the documents either in the main distribution of
  Sage or through the online repository (see collaborative tools).
\item Massive online introduction course to Sage, drawing on the sage tutorial/notebooks.
Could be "First year Sage course in a box".
\item Taking the opportunity of Python courses to propose Sage as a natural extension
for mathematics; an example is French's 
% TODO: The url macro eats the accented letters.
``Classes pr\'eparatoires''\footnote{
\url{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classe_préparatoire_aux_grandes_écoles}}, 
where Python has been recently selected as the language to learn programming\footnote{See 
the ``Annexe'' at 
\url{http://www.education.gouv.fr/pid25535/bulletin_officiel.html?cid_bo=71586}}.
%\item \TODO{please expand!}
\end{itemize}

% Jeroen: About teaching: in Gent, Sage is already integrated in the
% courses (maybe you can add this, don't know if it's relevant)
% starting in the first year. It's good for the students because it
% helps in 2 ways: it helps them to understand the mathematics better
% and it helps them to learn basic down-to-earth programming (they
% also have a programming course in Java but that contains a lot of
% theory about complicated class structures)
% Same thing in Orsay
% More python centered but same in UZH
