\begin{wpobjectives}
  The objective of this work package is to organize and optimize the
  communication with the larger community. This includes:
  \begin{itemize}
  \item reviewing emerging technologies;
  \item disseminating research results to the scientific community;
  \item ensuring awareness of the results in the user community;
  \item raising general public awareness of the \TheProject project;
  \item defining individual exploitation plans; and,
  \item managing existing and new intellectual property.
  \end{itemize}
\end{wpobjectives}

\begin{wpdescription}
  Dissemination: software, APIs, technologies, research results, ...
\end{wpdescription}

\begin{tasklist}
\begin{task}[title=Reviewing emerging technologies]
  In this task, we will produce periodic reviews of emerging
  technologies and relevant developments elsewhere, and implications
  for our plans. This include the review of standard components and
  service for storage and sharing, computational resources,
  authentication, package management, etc. This may further include
  negotiating access or shared development when appropriate. This
  information will be fed to the other work packages, in particular
  Work Package~\ref{wp:component-architecture} Component Architecture.
\end{task}

\begin{task}[title=Dissemination and Communication activities]

  \TODO{scale this down as appropriate}

  This task comprises all forms of direct dissemination and public
  communication activities such as press releases, creation of the
  project web-site including visitor analysis and monitoring tools
  (\ref{del:website}), scientific and technical publications, outreach
  activities (seminars, keynote talks, media interviews, press
  releases), pro- motion through social media (e.g. twitter, facebook,
  linkedin), technical workshop organisation, creation of
  advertisement materials such as flyers, posters, and electronic
  feeds as well as their distribution.

  % News articles will be produced by experienced professional staff
  % at relevant partners including ... and communicated to local,
  % national and international media, as appropriate.

  At least two press releases will be generated in the course of the
  project (\ref{del:pressrelease}, \ref{del:finalpressrelease}), and
  the project will organise at least one open technical workshop each
  year. % In fact many more?

Raw material:
\begin{itemize}
\item Documentation improvements: overview, cross links, overview of
  recent improvements
\item Thematic tutorials
\item Collections of pedagogical documents\\
  E.g. a complete collection of interactive class notes with computer
  lab projects for the ``Algèbre et Calcul formel'' option of the
  French math aggregation (starting from 2014-2015, only open-source
  systems will be supported, and Sage is a major player).
  % See http://nicolas.thiery.name/Enseignement/Agregation/ as a starter
  % Math labs with Sage for first year students in France (L1): http://math.univ-lyon1.fr/~omarguin/
\item Localization of the Sage user interface and key documents in
  various European languages.
\item Distribution of the documents either in the main distribution of
  Sage or through the online repository (see collaborative tools).
\item Massive online introduction course to Sage, drawing on the sage tutorial/notebooks.
Could be "First year Sage course in a box".
\item Taking the opportunity of Python courses to propose Sage as a natural extension
for mathematics; an example is French's 
% TODO: The url macro eats the accented letters. 
% It doesn't just eat it, it pukes it back!
``Classes pr\'eparatoires''\footnote{
\url{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classe_préparatoire_aux_grandes_écoles}}, 
where Python has been recently selected as the language to learn programming\footnote{See 
the ``Annexe'' at 
\url{http://www.education.gouv.fr/pid25535/bulletin_officiel.html?cid_bo=71586}}.
%\item \TODO{please expand!}
\end{itemize}

% Jeroen: About teaching: in Gent, Sage is already integrated in the
% courses (maybe you can add this, don't know if it's relevant)
% starting in the first year. It's good for the students because it
% helps in 2 ways: it helps them to understand the mathematics better
% and it helps them to learn basic down-to-earth programming (they
% also have a programming course in Java but that contains a lot of
% theory about complicated class structures)
% Same thing in Orsay
% More python centered but same in UZH
