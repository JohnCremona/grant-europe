The objectives of this work package are to:
\begin{itemize}
\item \TODO{Neil: Can we add something about scientific repeatability and sharing of mathematical models? I'm very keen to see systems where I can share a mathematical abstraction with a scientist in such a user-friendly way that they feel compelled to interact with it and develop their understanding of the modelling more. This might be an appropriate place to put this idea.}
\item
\item
\item Development models for an academic free software ecosystem
\item Supporting the Mathematical Process

\begin{task}[title=Modern Distribution of Scientific Output]
  \TODO{Neil: a suggested task in this domain, it's an area I've been thinking about a lot and it could fit in here. }
  The current model for distribution of scientific output stems from an era when the printing press was dominant. The process has become formalized through peer review and publication of journals. The PDF format for distribution of documents reflects the status quo, that a scientific paper is a written as if for printing and remains an unchanging document. In scientific blogging we are seeing that more rapid propagation of ideas can occur when the constrains of the printed format are released, however, there is a lack of formalization that means attribution of ideas and commentary run amiss. We will develope tools and ideas for distribution of scientific knowledge that don't rely on a static format and allow for the full spectrum of scientific debate. The tools will encourage proper credit attiribution through encouraging sharing of attribition for ideas, software and data. \TOWRITE{One deliverable simple idea would be to enable the construction of 'Living Posters' which can be interacted with, targeted at large touch screens.}
