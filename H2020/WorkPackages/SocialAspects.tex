\begin{wpobjectives}
The primary objective of this work package is to analyse the ``mutual crowdsourcing''
phenomenon occuring in the framework of development and maintainance of an open-source 
virtual research environment. 
We will focus on identifying the insentives for all
participants of the system, that would encourage sustained development of the
most important parts.  To this end, we will use ideas from the
recent reaserch on crowdsourcing in algorithmic mechanism design.
While doing so, we will apply outcomes to a case study
system.
Further, we will study development models for an academic free software ecosystem,
and analyse how they facilitate the mathematical process behind
relevant  algorithms and databases.
Finally, we will look into the questions of trust in results produced
by computations done by VREs, and ways to mitigate the issues arising there.

\begin{wpdescription}
Crowdsourcing is a recent fenomenon
in software development in particular, but not only there. E.g. 
crowdsourcing of mathematical ideas occurs in online
mathematics communities, such as Mathoverflow \cite{mathoverflow} and
in Polymath Projects \cite{polymath}. 
``Mutual crowdsourcing'' is the main driving force
in developing and maintaining of any large-scale open-source 
virtual research environment. 

Open source projects tend to be fragile, in the community sense, and
suffer from disagreements that ultimately result in forks and
the resulting repetition of effort. We will analyse this in 
a setup of cooperative game theory, and try to design
a finely tuned systems of insentives and rewards for contribution, to increse
the stability of the community and its useful output.

We will focus on identifying the appropriate insentives for all
participants of the system, that would encourage sustained development of the
most important parts of the system.  To this end, we will use ideas from the
burgeoning field of meachnism design \cite{AGTbook} and in
particular on recent reaserch on crowdsourcing in algorithmic mechanism design
\cite{crowds}.  While doing so, we will apply outcomes to a case study
system---Sagemath.
We will apply preference and opinion aggregation techniques \cite{pref-aggr} to  develop
a community prioritisation scheme for Sagemath bugs and features requests, which 
are presently being mainitened on the Sagemath Trac server \cite{trac-sagemath}  and implement
them as a Trac \cite{Trac} add-on.

As well, we will study various development models for an academic free software ecosystem,
and analyse how they facilitate the mathematical process behind algorithms being
designed and implemented,  and databases of experimental data and test cases being
created and expanded.
Trusting results of computer
computations is crucial for usability; channels for communicating bug reports
and fixes need to be carefyully analysed from social point of view. 
Commercial closed source computer algebra and other computational systems often
fail to react to bug reports in a timely manner, and seemingly are falling into the
short-sighted trap of hiding bugs from potential and current users \cite{misfort},
Open source  systems are only marginally better in this way, as recent
computer security scares, such as the one around Bash \cite{shellshock}, indicate.
A game-theoretic analysis of this situation will be attempted.
