\begin{WPObjectives}
  The objectives of \theWP{} is to design interfaces that can be used
  for a wide range of mathematical data, facilities for accepting
  contributions while tracking provenance and credit, standard
  metadata allowing database discovery, versioning allowing stable
  references, citability, recomputation without copying the entire
  database into VM.

  Participants: Warwick, Zurich, Logilab (SME in Paris)

  \item Finite groups (Max)
  \item Lattices

\item \ref{del:persistent_memoization} (Month X): Shared persistent
  memoization library for Python/Sage.  Typical use case: A group of
  collaborators is using intensively a given function (in Sage, or in
  their private code). They want to memoize the results, as with
  e.g. Sage's \lstinline{cached_method}, but across sessions.  They
  further want to share the underlying growing database between
  themselves, and maybe eventually publish it.

  Features:
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Use, further extend, and contribute back to some established
    (Python?) persistent memoization infrastructure. E.g.
    \begin{itemize}
    \item \url{https://pythonhosted.org/joblib/memory.html}
    \item \url{github.com/vivekn/redis-simple-cache}
    \item \url{bitbucket.org/zzzeek/dogpile.cache}
    \end{itemize}
  \item Apply not only to user-level functions, but also to lower
    level functions, e.g. in the Sage library, so that indirect calls
    to the function also get memoized.
  \item Trivial to setup and configure for the end user: in a single
    line, the user selects an existing function, a backend (with a
    default value), maybe provide some semantic information, and
    voil√†. \\
    Typical interface: a decorator to be set on appropriate functions.
    \TODO{Mock code}
    % mycloud = storage("ssh:xxx@yyy/zzz")
    % memoize(sage.combinat...., storage=mycloud, input=ZZ, output=Posets(), key="catalan")
  \item Trivial to setup and configure for groups of researchers, with
    a wide range of storage backends (e.g. shared dropbox folder,
    remote directory, database, git repository, ...).
  \item Easy to setup data-bot: e.g. launching a virtual machine that
    systematically fills up the shared database.
  \item Versioning and provenance tracking (user, algorithm, software
    version, ...), for quality certification, credit, ...
  \item Recomputation?
  \item Ease of publishing, importing, ...
  \item Usual database properties: atomicity, merging (easy since the
    results are supposed to be immutable: just need to merge the
    tracking info), alerts in case of divergence.
  \end{itemize}
