A quality assurance plan will be established to ensure coherent and sufficient quality of the workand results. The plan will be developed by UPS, involving all partners, and will be followed upregularly. In addition, the project coordinator with support from the coordination team and quality review board will establish and review annually a risk management plan and self-assessment to ensure that technical barriers / potential risks are identified  and corrective measures are put into place on time (\delivref{management}{ipr}).

\begin{task}[title=Innovation management,
id=project-finance-management,lead=PS,PM=10]
One of the most important criteria for success for the OpenDreamKit project is to bring the project results into use. Therefore, exploitation routes will be sought whenever possible. Inorder to create a common understanding within the Consortium about how we can best usheran idea all the way from conception to its realization and exploitation, the Coordinator will be responsible forthe preparation and realization of an Innovation Plan to assure that research activities meet therequired milestones and the outputs of innovation are fully aligned with the project objectives.All research activities will go through three initial steps where the exploitation opportunity isidentified along with the main stakeholders for the exploitation opportunity and an IP owner.
