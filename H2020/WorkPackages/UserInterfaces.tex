\begin{wpdescription}
  Project \Jupyter is a set of open-source software projects for interactive and exploratory
  computing. These software projects help make scientific computing and data science reproducible
  and multi-language (Python, Julia, R, Haskell, etc.). The main application offered by \Jupyter is
  the \Jupyter notebook, a web-based interactive computing platform that allows users to create
  data- and code-driven narratives that combine live code, equations, narrative text, interactive
  dashboards and other rich media. These documents provide a complete record of a computation that
  can be shared with others.

  The \Jupyter notebook is being used in all areas of academic
  (including for example University of California, Berkeley, Stanford,
  MIT, Harvard, Cambridge, Oxford, Imperial College, Southampton,
  Hamburg, Paderborn, Vienna, Paris, Katowice, and Oslo) and
  government (NASA JPL, LBL, KBase, White House Hackathon) research as
  well as industry (Google, IBM, Facebook, Oracle, Otto Group,
  Microsoft, Bloomberg, JP Morgan, WhatsApp, Oâ€™Reilly, Quantopian,
  Logilab, GraphLab, Enthought, Continuum, Authorea, BuzzFeed, etc.)
  and journalism (538, New York Times, etc.). Because the architecture
  and building blocks of \Jupyter are open, they are being used to
  build numerous other commercial and non-profit products and
  services. The \Jupyter Notebook has between 500,000 and 1.5 million
  individual users worldwide.

  In this work package, we will add new functionality to the \Jupyter
  Notebook that fosters excellence in computational science and
  research. In particular, we will push towards reproducible and
  effective science by allowing to create structured documents (such
  as reports, books, theses) from Notebooks, and by allowing those
  notebooks to be re-executed as self-contained regression tests. We
  will also unify the notebook infrastructure used in \Sage with
  \Jupyter, push forward dynamic documentation exploration
  capabilities, and work towards concurrent multi-user editing of
  Notebooks.

  The last tasks in this work package are focused on an
  \emph{application of the \Jupyter notebook technology} for education
  and research.

\TOWRITE{Hans-Petter / Marcin?}{Say something about notebook for
  education and planned demonstrators [notebooks]?}

To demonstrate the power of the \TheProject environment to accelerate
computational science, deliver better value for money and make
computational science more robust, we will put together a micromagnetic
Virtual Research Environment (micromagnetic VRE) for a simulation
package that is actively used in materials research by a wide range of
scientists and engineers, in academia and industry. We have chosen the
Object Oriented MicroMagnetic Framework (OOMMF) simulation package
\cite{OOMMF-url} as the target tool which is used to simulate magnetic
nanostructures in over 1800 publications \cite{OOMMF-citations-url} as
there is a wide community to benefit from it.

\begin{tasklist}
\begin{task}[title=Uniform notebook interface for all interactive components,id=ipython-kernels,lead=PS]
  In this task, we will implement \Jupyter interfaces for the
  interactive computation components of \TheProject, including GAP,
  Pari, \Sage, and Singular. A first release
  \delivref{UI}{ipython-kernels-basic} will focus on basic functionality,
  and a second release \delivref{UI}{ipython-kernels} will cover advanced
  features like 3D graphics or transparent documentation browsing (as
  live worksheets whenever relevant).

  % Note from William: my student Andrew Ohana just mostly did
  % something like that for IPython, but then stopped.  Anyway, it's
  % very do-able based on a summer project from another student and a
  % bunch of work I did with THREE.js for SMC.

  \Sage itself will require a specific treatment as it already has a
  notebook interface. Its development started about at the same time
  as the \Jupyter notebook, with similar target features but a
  different agenda: the \Sage notebook had to be available very quickly
  to solve pressing needs of the \Sage community; instead the \Jupyter
  notebook was to take its time and build robust foundations from the
  ground up. The two projects have exchanged a lot, and the \Jupyter
  notebook, which benefits from a much larger user base and thus
  developer pool, has mostly caught up with the \Sage notebook in terms
  of functionality. It's thus time for the \Sage community to outsource
  this key but non disciplinary component and phase out the \Sage
  notebook in favor of the \Jupyter notebook.

  % In charge: Jupyter dev + dev in Orsay + community?
  The \Sage and \Jupyter convergence \delivref{UI}{ipython-kernel-sage} will
  require:
  \begin{compactitem}
  \item Robust migration path and tools for \Sage worksheets,
  \item Support for math, 2D, and interactive 3D scene visualization,
    % \item Bundling of the \Jupyter notebook and its dependencies within
    %   the Sage distribution. DONE
  \item Import and export of ReST documents, with full support for
    \Sage's specific roles (math, ...),
  \item Support for remote \Sage kernel, typically on the cloud, or
    running with a different Python version (\Sage as a library),
  \item A migration path for interactive widgets implemented with
    \Sage's \texttt{@interact} functionality.
  \end{compactitem}

  Joint meetings and visits between the developers of \Jupyter and of
  the computing components will be a key asset for this task.

\end{task}

\begin{task}[id=notebook-collab,title=Notebook improvements for collaboration,lead=SR]
  In this task, we will further improve tools for collaboration between
  authors of shared \Jupyter notebooks.

  Version control tools, such as Git and Mercurial, have become an integral part of open and
  collaborative science and software. Version control tools allow reviewing proposed changes via
  diffing tools, and resolving conflicting changes with merge tools. \Jupyter notebook documents,
  being text files, are relatively well suited to tracking in version control. However, being
  structured JSON data, diffing and merging are difficult. Tools shall be developed to provide
  better support for visual diffing and merging of Notebook documents, and integrated into existing
  version control workflows \delivref{UI}{jupyter-collab}.

  Given the interactive nature of \Jupyter notebooks, live collaboration, where multiple authors
  work on the document simultaneously, as in Google Docs, is particularly desirable. The addition
  of potentially shared execution adds both value and challenge to live collaboration. Various
  projects have added some amount of live sessions from outside (\SMC, Colaboratory), but
  outside the core project. There are many different aspects of collaboration to explore,
  including shared or separate execution for authors collaborating on a single notebook,
  UI to indicate not only authorship,
  but which author triggered which execution, and other challenges.
  Various avenues for live session collaboration will be explored for integration into \Jupyter itself
  \delivref{UI}{jupyter-live-collab}.
\end{task}




\begin{task}[id=notebook-verification,title=Reproducible Notebooks,lead=SR]
  In this task, we will develop tools that allow to re-execute
  notebook documents with automated regression testing. The computed
  output will be compared against the stored output, and deviations
  reported as assertion errors.

  Notebooks are used in a variety of contexts, like training and
  teaching material (tutorials, documentation, books) or computer
  experimentation logbooks, where reproducibility is critical: the
  notebooks shall remain functional and correct in the long run, even
  when the underlying computational software or infrastructure changes
  over time or across platforms.

  This task is a critical step toward reproducibility, allowing the
  notebook author to get an immediate notice when, e.g., a backward
  incompatible change occurs. It becomes even possible to anticipate
  such situations upstream by including important notebooks directly
  in the automated test suite of the computational software, giving an
  easy way for casual users to contribute regression tests.

  Technically speaking, \Jupyter notebooks store outputs as rich mime-type structures,
  with JSON metadata. Using this metadata, it will be possible to express
  expectations of output, allowing more flexible and powerful tests
  than direct text comparison \delivref{UI}{jupyter-test}.
  Prior work has been done in \Sage for ReST files, e.g. \lstinline{sage -t notebook.rst},
  and this model will be extended to notebooks.
\end{task}

\begin{task}[id=sage-sphinx, title=Refactor \Sage's \Sphinx documentation system, PM=6]
  \Sage, like \Python and many other \Python based projects, uses the
  \Sphinx documentation system. Due to particularly stringent needs,
  many layers of customization and adaptations have accumulated over
  the years, in particular for proper scaling to the sheer size of the
  Sage documentation (13k pages just for the reference manual).

  A deep refactorization (\delivref{UI}{sage-sphinx}) is critically needed to get rid of multiple
  duplication, and foster sustainability by outsourcing back to \Sphinx
  all generic aspects (parallel compilation, index generation, ...).
  % In charge: dev in Orsay or Logilab + visit of Sphinx dev  + FH
\end{task}

\begin{task}[id=dynamic-inspect,title=Dynamic documentation and exploration system]
  Introspection has become a critical tool in interactive computation,
  allowing user to explore on the fly the properties and capabilities
  of the objects under manipulation. This becomes particularly acute
  in systems like \Sage where large parts of the class hierarchy is
  built dynamically, and static documentation builders like \Sphinx
  cannot anymore render all the available information.

  In this task, we will investigate how to further enhance the user
  experience. This will include:
  \begin{compactitem}
  \item On the fly generation of Javadoc style documentation, through
    introspection, allowing e.g. the exploration of the class
    hierarchy, available methods, etc.
  \item Widgets based on the HTML5 and web component standards to display
    graphical views of the results of SPARQL queries, as well as populating data
    structures with the results of such queries,
    % TODO by Logilab PM=2
  \item \delivref{UI}{ipython-advanced-interacts} (Month 36)
    Exploratory support for semantic-aware interactive widgets
    providing views on objects of the underlying computational or
    database components. Preliminary steps are demonstrated in the
    \texttt{Larch Environment} project (see demo video on
    \url{http://www.larchenvironment.com/}) and
    \software{sage-explorer}
    (\url{https://github.com/jbandlow/sage-explorer}). The ultimate
    aim would be to automatically generate \LMFDB-style interfaces.
  \end{compactitem}
  Whenever possible, those features will be implemented generically
  for any computation kernel by extending the \Jupyter protocol with
  introspection and documentation queries.
  % In charge: \Jupyter dev + dev in Orsay + NT?
\end{task}

\begin{task}[title=Structured documents,id=structdocs,lead=JU,PM=24]
  % \item \delivref{ipython-structured-documents} (Month ???)
  Support for writing interactive structured documents, and in
  particular papers, books, experimentation log books and reports,
  presentations, course notes, etc, with the following features:
  \begin{compactitem}
  \item Static printed/PDF/HTML version and interactive version.\\
    Achieved by either importing or exporting document files in some
    standard format (LaTeX, ReST, Markdown, ...).
  \item Tests (\localtaskref{notebook-verification}).
  \item Collaborative editing.
  \item Version control.
  \end{compactitem}
  \TODO{MK: some transition}
  MathHub.info is a portal for reading and interacting with "active documents"
  (i.e. documents that have an additional semantic layer that supports semantic services
  like definition lookup, type-inference, unit conversion,\ldots)

  Notebooks are essentially ``programs with documentation'', whereas active documents are
  documents with a semantic knowledge layer. Regular publications are an important
  boundary case: Active Documents look like papers, but are web-standards compatible and
  interactive.

  sTeX is a semantic variant of LaTeX that we can transform into OMDoc/MMT, which is the
  native knowledge representation format for active documents and machine-actionable
  knowledge about math and symbolic programs.
\end{task}

\begin{task}[id=mathhub,title=Active Documents Portal,lead=JU,PM=12]
  We will extend the existing \url{http://mathhub.info} systeml to a portal for
  interacting with active/structured documents (see \localtaskref{structdocs}) and run it
  for internal use in the \TheProject first and later for general use outside the
  project. \url{MathHub.info} alread provides very basic sTeX editing and verisoning. For
  \TheProject we will need to extend it with the computational side based on the
  integrated format from \localtaskref{structdocs}.
\end{task}


\begin{task}[lead=USO,title=Case study: micromagnetic VRE built from
  \TheProject,id=oommf-py-ipython-attributes,PM=6]
  % 6 person months

%refer to deliverable:
  In this task, we use the \TheProject architecture to assemble a
  virtual research environment software tailored for the large
  community of researchers in magnetic materials that use simulation
  studies for their work (see introduction in description on page
  \pageref{page:description-of-micromagnetic-vre}). These researchers in
  academia and industry are typically not computationalists and use
  simulation to support their experiments and analytical work.

  The micromagnetic VRE will be based on the \Jupyter Notebook, the
  Python interface to the micromagnetic simulation library OOMMF
  (\taskref{component-architecture}{oommf-python-interface}),
  and the additional features added to \Jupyter in this work
  package. The pool of several thousand OOMMF users are the direct
  beneficiaries of this demonstrator, but we will extract further and
  more generic lessons and insight from it (for example
  \taskref{social-aspects}{oommf-nb-evaluation}).

  The \Jupyter Notebook environment allows to host,
  execute and document the Python-based OOMMF simulation in an
  executable document. In this interactive environment, objects can be
  displayed using various representations, including, for example,
  textual representation (i.e. strings), bitmap images and SVG (vector
  graphics) files. We will create functionality so that magnetisation vector
  field objects can be presented as a rendered 3d and 2d-view of the
  magnetisation field, and similar features for scalar fields such as
  field components and energies (linking to
  \localtaskref{cfd-vis}). This allows computational steering and the
  interactive exploration of the behavior of magnetic
  nanostructures.

  Beyond that, the \Jupyter Widgets allow the creation of graphical
  user interface (GUI) elements, and we will generate code to
  display these widgets on demand to (i) set up micromagnetic
  simulations using a GUI, and (ii) assist in common post-processing
  simulation results. Recent pilot work has shown that it is possible
  to make \Jupyter Widgets interact with the Python interpreter
  session and this allows to activate a GUI-like (widget based)
  interface when desired but to quickly return to the interpreter
  prompt, taking forward the results (data) from the GUI session
  \cite{IPython-widget-GUI-demo-youtube-2014} and providing a
  continuous path from scripting to GUI. We believe that having the
  ability to mix and match GUI-based and command driven analysis
  combines the best of both approaches, caters for users' preferences,
  and provides significant additional value.

  The deliverable for this task is the open source micromagnetic VRE
  software (\delivref{UI}{oommf-nb}).
\end{task}

\begin{task}[lead=USO,title=Demonstrator: micromagnetic VRE notebooks,
  id=oommf-tutorial-and-documentation, PM=6]
  % 5 person months + 1 month co-investigator [Ian Hawke's experience]

  The purpose of the micromagnetic VRE
  (\localtaskref{oommf-py-ipython-attributes}) is to enable excellent
  computational research. To maximise the value of this grant's investment for the
  community, we will not carry out micromagnetic research but instead
  produce a set of executable notebooks using the micromagnetic VRE
  to demonstrate its power and applicability.

  We will create executable notebook documents (\delivref{UI}{oommf-nb-documentation}) within the micromagnetic VRE
  including (i) a new tutorial on usage of OOMMF, (ii) the complete
  documentation of the \texttt{OOMMF-Py} library, and (iii) a set of
  typical micromagnetic case studies. The tutorial, in terms of
  content, will take guidance from the tutorial provided for Nmag
  \cite{Nmag-tutorial-url} but is tailored for the special simulation
  capabilities of underlying micromagnetic OOMMF library, and will
  introduce the additional features of the \Jupyter-driven
  micromagnetic VRE. We expect this substantial and executable
  documentation of the micromagnetic VRE to become the standard
  resource that introduces researchers to computational
  micromagnetics, in particular through the online portal (\localtaskref{oommf-nb-ve}).

  %% This block is about the benefits of using the notebook. It should
  %% go somewhere eles in more geneci form:
  %The output of this activity will deliver multiple benefits:
  %providing a systematic introduction to \texttt{OOMMF-py} suitable for both
  %those users (i) new to micromagnetic modelling and those (ii) new to
  %the \texttt{OOMMF-py} interface. Because the documentation is developed in an
  %\Jupyter notebook, the documents are executable. For new learners
  %this is a great simplification because they can skip through the
  %given document and execute the given examples there and then: at the
  %moment, this is a process of manually writing a script, or locating
  %it in the directory structure of files, then executing this,
  %subsequently opening and processing the data files, etc. In the new
  %model, this end-to-end simulation will start from specifying the
  %material parameters in the notebook (all of this is given in the
  %tutorial), to running the simulation in the notebook to processing
  %of computed data while the simulation runs (or subsequently) in the
  %notebook; thus providing one virtual research environment, with all
  %the associated benefits of making best use of the scientist's time
  %using the tool and environment.

\end{task}

\begin{task}[lead=USO,id=oommf-nb-ve,title=Online portal for
  micromagnetic VRE demonstrator,PM=3]

  % 3 person months
  Recently, a TeMPorary \Jupyter NoteBook (TMPNB) has been made
  available (at \href{http://tmpnb.org}{http://tmpnb.org}) that allows
  anybody to open this URL and use their very own \Jupyter notebook
  for quick calculations and tests online. We will provide such a
  portal (\delivref{UI}{oommf-nb-tmp}) which provides the micromagnetic VRE for anonymous use. This
  service allows users to execute the demonstrator tutorial and
  documentation notebooks
  (\localtaskref{oommf-tutorial-and-documentation}) and run the
  calculations in real time on the web server, without having to
  install any software on their own machine.  This webservice will be
  based on Docker \cite{Docker} virtualisation technology and we will
  make available the scripts to create VirtualBox \cite{Virtualbox}
  images, and Docker containers. The same virtual machine images can
  also be used for Cloudhosted computing services.

  We request 6000 EUR to purchase a machine to provide these
  services (shared memory, 64 cores, 128GB RAM, Solid-state drive (SDD)
  to make the system more responsive). 
  %This machine will also support
  %the regression testing and continuous integration (see task
  %\taskref{dissem}{dissemination-of-oommf-nb-virtual-environment}).
  %Setup and

\begin{task}[title=Visualization system for 3d data in web-notebook
, id=cfd-vis]

The \Jupyter notebook is a very attractive environment for building
user interfaces for research, but the current support for inline
visualization is limited to curve plots and 2d scalar fields.  Many
scientific simulations need visualization of 3d scalar and vector
fields.  The amount of data can be tremendous, especially in
time-dependent problems computed in a distributed fashion over
large-scale computational clusters. Interactive inspection of such
simulations can be a valuable tool which accelerates research. For
inspection, one does not need to transfer and gather the full dataset
at each time step - getting selected computed fields on user request
or preprocessing certain quantities like cross sections with some
predefined frequency will mostly suffice.

We propose to let computational fluid dynamics (CFD) be a driving
application for the development of 3d visualization in \Jupyter
notebooks since CFD is one of the most demanding cases of scientific
visualization. Successfully handling CFD makes the tool immediately
applicable to a range of other fields such as heat transfer,
electromagnetics, material science, and 3d algebraic structures in
mathematics. Simulations are started inside the notebook and executed
on HPC clusters. This approach will significantly lower the threshold
for using parallel computing codes that can be hard to install
correctly on local workstations. Such use cases with 3d visualization
will greatly extend the potential applications of the \Jupyter
notebook concept throughout science and engineering.

As example code for a 3d live web notebook with fluid dynamics
simulations, we will use the Lattice Boltzmann solver which is under
development at the University of Silesia:
\href{http://sailfish.us.edu.pl/}{Sailfish}.  This code is an advanced
Lattice Boltzmann solver designed from the ground up for distributed
system of GPU compute clusters. It is implemented predominantly in
Python, and it uses run-time code generation techniques to
automatically build optimized code for CUDA and OpenCL devices. Since
running Sailfish requires specialized hardware, it is reasonable to
use it on dedicated HPC installations.

The project must first investigate available technologies for fast
in-browser visualization via \href{http://vispy.org}{Vispy} and then
determine the most appropriate visualization techniques for the
typical structures to be displayed (isosurfaces, streamlines, flow
sheets, etc.).  After a proof of concept is established by
researchers, a precise description of the visualization tool can be
subcontracted to professional IT developers.
