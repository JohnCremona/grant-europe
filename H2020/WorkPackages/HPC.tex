\begin{WPObjectives}
  The objective of this work package is to improve the performance of
  the computational components of \TheProject, in particular on
  massively parallel architectures. This includes notably:
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Fine grained High Performance Computing on many-cores
    architectures.
  \item Coarse grained or embarrassingly parallel computing on grids
    or on the cloud.
  \item Compilation of high level interpreted code to optimized
    parallel C/C++.
  \item Develop novel HPC infrastructure in the context of
    combinatorics.
  \end{itemize}
  A key aspect will be to foster further sharing expertise and best
  practices between computational components.
\end{WPObjectives}

\begin{WPDescription}
  As in all other areas of science, properly supporting massively
  parallel architecture is a major challenge. Many of the
  computational components in \TheProject have already gone a long way
  in this direction. For example, an adaptation of the \GAP kernel for
  HPC was developed during the 2009-2013 EPSRC project. The expertise
  gained there was then transferred to the ongoing \Singular-HPC
  project, in particular through the rehiring of one of the developers
  of \GAP-HPC.

  In this work package, we will build on this momentum to further
  implement HPC support in the components Tasks~\ref{task:hpc_pari},
  \ref{task:hpc_linbox}, and \ref{task:hpc_singular}.

  \TODO{transition}

  Many of the computational components of \TheProject use a high level
  interpreted language for their library. This is notably the case of
  \Sage. Performance is achieved by compiling critical sections using
  the \Cython \Python-to-C compiler. In
  Tasks~\ref{task:pythran_cython} and~\ref{task:pythran_sage}, we will also
  boost performance by further developing and applying such
  compilation tools.

\begin{task}{Pythran-Cython convergence}
  \label{task:pythran_cython}
  \TOWRITE{SG}{Expand task: Pythran-Cython convergence}

  \Pythran is a \Python to C++ compiler for a subset of the \Python
  language. It is meant to efficiently compile scientific programs,
  and takes advantage of multi-cores and SIMD instruction units.
  Thanks to type inference, it requires little annotations.

  \Cython is a \Python to C compiler that was originally developed for
  \Sage and is now a thriving project of its own. It can handle
  essentially any \Python code, and in particular classes, but relies
  heavily on annotations for producing optimized code.

  Therefore, \Pythran and \Cython are similar in spirit but have
  complementary feature sets. In this task, we will investigate the
  opportunity and feasibility of a convergence between \Cython and
  \Pythran: depending on the code at hand, one strategy or the other
  would be automatically selected. Also, it should be able to integrate an
  improved compiler-runtime cooperation in the \Cython compiler thanks to
  part of the \Pythran-runtime and the extra typing information provided by
  \Cython. An effort will be made to improve more and more the parallelism in
  the Pythran-runtime.

  This work will be achieved by a close collaboration between the
  \Pythran developers hired for \TheProject and \Cython developers
  involved in the \Sage project. It should quicken \Sage execution time at least
  on numpy centric codes.

\end{task}

\begin{task}{\Pythran for \Sage}
  \label{task:pythran_sage}
  \TOWRITE{SG}{Expand task: Pythran for Sage}
  Currently, \Sage doesn't provide facilities to improve user written Python
  code improvement as the Cython compiler required heavily annotated code. As
  Pythran doesn't need these informations, a notebook interface to compile Pythran
  compliant code will he added in Sage to improve user kernels.

  Internally, \Sage uses \Cython for compiling the critical sections of
  its libraries. In this task, we will explore opportunities to
  benefit from Pythran compilation within the Sage library, in
  particular toward better support for parallelism. A specific
  challenge is that the \Sage library uses quite heavily
  object-oriented programming.

  This task will strongly benefit from Task~\ref{task:pythran_cython},
  while providing in return a real life large-scale use case for it.

  A first step to support object-oriented programming will be to make Pythran
  typing better which will improve error information provided for the user.
