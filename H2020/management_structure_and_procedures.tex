\TODO{An open source architecture allows risk sharing: collaborating
  in the early stages of research could help an early detection, and,
  by consequence, reducing risks.}

\TODO{But: since Open Source softwares are freely accessible, security
  and privacy issues are a concern. Anytime a resource is shared,
  there is greater risk of unauthorised access and contaminated data.
  Providers must demonstrate security solutions, which should include
  physical security controlling access to the facility and protection
  of user data from corruption and cyber attacks.}
