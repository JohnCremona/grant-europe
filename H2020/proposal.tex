\section{Excellence}

The focus of \TheProject is on promoting community-developed open
source software, databases, and services adapted to the needs of
collaborative research in pure mathematics and applications.

It will consolidate Europe's leading position in computational
mathematics and build on the remarkable success of the ecosystem of
projects like \GAP, \Python, \Sage, \Pari, \Singular, \LMFDB.

The development of effective, flexible and easy-to-use VRE technology
is especially important for mathematicians, because their research
groups tend to be small and can be isolated.

\textbf{Objective~\ref{objective:framework}}

Computational techniques have become a core asset for research in pure
  mathematics and its applications in the last decades. Mathematics
  communities have come together to develop powerful computational
  tools, such as GAP, Pari, SAGE or Singular, and valuable on-line
  services such as the Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences and the ATLAS
  of Group Representations. \TODO{cite} In building these systems, 
  mathematicians have gained strong
  experience in collaborative software development, with pioneering
  work and continuing leadership of Europe.

A number of approaches to linking these resources have been developed,
such as the SCSCP protocol from the Framework 6 SCIEnce project, and
the incorporation of a variety of free software tools in the SAGE
system, but the overall model is still that of a single mathematician
running programmes or interacting with a ``notebook''
page. The software provides little or no support for other aspects of
mathematical research: collaboration,
archival, reproducibility or linkage between programmes, data and
publication. Databases are updated mainly by mathematicians directly,
retaining no record of the source of new entries, and providing no way
of refering to the actual version of the data used in a particular
computation.

The first objective of this project is to design an architecture which
will allow existing mathematical software systems (suitably updated), 
off-the shelf non-mathematical tools and a small number of new
components to be flexibly combined to produce a VRE that will
effectively support collaborative mathematical research throughout
it's entire life-cycle. This will include software APIs and standards,
frameworks for assuring the semantic consistency of similar
mathematical objects in different systems.  It will be informed by the
outputs of objective \ref{objective:social}, ensuring that the VREs
fit the ways that mathematicians actually work.



\textbf{Objective~\ref{objectives:tools}}

Most of the direct mathematical capabilities of our software will come
from existing open source mathematical systems. For instance we will
use the power of the GAP Library for computational group theory or
Pari for number theory. Generic services such as storage, version
control, authentication and resource accounting will come from
off-the-shelf components building on standard infrastructures. 

Nevertheless some new tools will be needed \TODO{what? or at least examples}


\TODO{Keyword: flexible/versatile virtual environment}

Our research will cover a wide variety of aspects, ranging from
software development models, user interfaces \TODO{virtual
  environments?}  deployment frameworks and novel collaborative tools,
component architecture, design, and standardization of software
components and databases, to links to publication, data archival and
reproducibility of experiments, development models and tools, and
social aspects. It will build on the remarkable success of the open
source ecosystem and consolidate Europe's leading position in
computational mathematics.

Following the call specifications, all software, data, and
publications resulting from this proposal will be open.

\textbf{Objective~\ref{objective:disseminate}}

The success of any research software or service is strongly related to its ability to attract and convince a great amount of users. Our different communities (Sage, Gap, Pari, Singular...) have developed a solid experience and network. As an example, Sage has gathered thousands of users in less than 10 years and Sage-Days are organised all over the world many times per year  \TODO{Ref to another part of the document where this is developed?}. Our objective is to disseminate and promote our work by a constant dialogue with the different communities: frequent workshops, conferences, user groups, mailing lists. By building on existing tools, we intend to involve the communities in the development process itself in the spirit of open-source software. 

We also intend to reach a larger crowd of researchers by cutting down non-research technical issues to access existing tools: building better documentation and tutorials, developing easy-to-install distributions, easy web and cloud access, better user interfaces, better interactions between different software. Doing so, our objective is to help the communities to grow themselves and interact together using our work.

\subsubsection{Why collaborative development of open source software?}

\TODO{Language to be moved in some form into the Concept section}

From their early days, computers have been used in pure mathematics,
either to prove theorems or, like the telescope for astronomers, to
explore new theories. Major achievements include the proof of the four
color theorem or \TODO{Nice flashy example?}. Usage has grown to the
point that certain areas of mathematics now completely depend on
experimental methods, with major efforts spent on software
development. As the sophistication of the required computations
increased, supported by the boom of the available computational power,
it became vital to share those efforts at the scale of large research
communities. European mathematicians have been pioneers and have grown
a steady tradition of collaborative open source software development,
with systems like GAP, Singular, or Pari/GP playing a major role for
decades.

\subsubsection{Importance of experimental tools in maths}

\TODO{Language to be moved in some form into the Concept section}

The field of computer algebra allows us to compute in and with a multitude
of mathematical structures. It is interdisciplinary in nature, with links to quite
a number of areas in mathematics, with applications in mathematics and other
branches of science and engineering, and with constantly new and often
surprising developments. Quite a number of these developments, in fact the
creation of whole subareas of the field,  have been iniated by European
researchers who made crucial contributions at all levels. These include the
design of fundamental algorithms, the development of major computer
algebra systems, applications of the computational methods in various fields,
and the creation of widely used databases.

Particular fruitful interactions unfold between computer algebra and
algebraic geometry, number theory, combinatorics and group theory. Algebraic algorithms
open up new ways of accessing subareas of these key disciplines of
mathematics, and they are fundamental to practical applications of the
disciplines. Conversely, challenges arising in algebraic geometry, number
theory, combinatorics and group theory quite often lead to algorithmic breakthroughs
which, in turn, open the door for new theoretical and practical applications
of computer algebra.

Based on exact computer aided calculations, the experimental method has
now been added to the toolbox of the pure mathematician. Experiments
lead to new conjectures which may have a deep impact on the future
development of mathematics. An outstanding example is the Birch and
Swinnerton-Dyer conjecture which is one of the Clay Millenium Problems.
Databases relying on computer calculations such as the Small Groups
Library or the Modular Atlas in group and representation theory provide
indispensible tools for researchers. A constructive way of understanding
proofs of deep theorems yields algorithmic tools to deal with highly abstract
concepts. These tools make the concepts available to a broader class of
researchers, with many potential applications. A prominent example from
algebraic geometry is the desingularization theorem of Hironaka, for which
Hironaka won the Fields Medal, and its algorithmization by Villamayor.

Spectacular theoretical breakthrougs such as Wiles' proof of Fermat's last
theorem are based on interdisciplinary approaches. Current developments
on the algorithmic side allow one to conquer crossconnections between
different areas of mathematics also computationally and, thus, to
arrive at cutting-edge applications which previously were inconceivable.

Other chunks of language:
\begin{itemize}
\item Mathematicians have a strong tradition of sharing knowledge
  openly (arxiv, Wikipedia, ...).

% Comment by William:

\item Mathematicians have been building and sharing databases for a
  long while; the needs for such is growing tremendously, and the
  process needs to be streamlined.
\item Specific situation of maths w.r.t. Data:
  \begin{itemize}
  \item More often than not data is the result of a computation (and
    not e.g.  an experiment). The role of databases is thus primarily
    to store results for later reuse (persistent caching), and enable
    searches. Because of this, many issues (semantic, ontologies,
    reproducibility, ...) are to be treated upstream at the level of
    software rather than data.
  \item extreme reification in mathematics makes classical ontologies techniques/RDF impractical
  \item interlinking very high
  \item several alternate and defining description of same objects
  \end{itemize}
\item Highlight some other deployed VRE's that would benefit to the
  sorts of improvements you suggest.  You could include Wakari.io and
  also the tmpnb thing in Nature magazine:

The SPP1489 ``Algorithmic and Experimental Methods in Algebra, Geometry, and
Number Theory'' is a nationwide Priority Project of the German Research Council DFG  
which commenced in July  2010 and will end in June 2016. The focus of the programme 
is on the interactions between computer algebra and algebraic geometry, number theory, 
and group theory. It combines expertise at all levels of research in computer algebra, 
be it the design of algorithms, the implementation of algorithms, the application
of algorithms, or the creation of mathematical databases. The goal of SPP1489 is to 
considerably further the algorithmic and experimental methods in the afore mentioned
disciplines, to combine the different methods across boundaries between the disciplines, 
and to apply them to central questions in theory and praxis. A fundamental concern of the
programme is the further development of open source
computer algebra systems with origins in Germany, which in
the framework of different projects will be crosslinked on
different levels. Of particular interest are interactions with application areas inside
and outside of mathematics such as system- and control theory, coding
theory, cryptography, CAD, algebraic combinatorics, and algebraic
statistics as well as hybrid methods which combine numerical and
symbolic approaches.

(1/1/2013-12/31/2014), in particular at the University of California,
Berkeley and California Polytechnic State University, San Luis Obispo.
This grant enabled the project to focus on developing the IPython
Notebook as a general tool for scientific and technical computing that
is open, collaborative and reproducible. This goes a long way toward
Aim \TODO{... and ...} of \TheProject, especially given the current
rapid evolution of IPython toward its language agnostic avatar
Jupyter.

\TheProject will build on the outcome of the Sloan grant, and further
develop the critical IPython/Jupyter component in close collaboration
with the IPython/Jupyter team. In particular, we plan to hire some of
the European developers that are currently funded by the Sloan grant
to work in California and wish to later return to Europe.

\paragraph{FLINT grant?}

\paragraph{LMFDB grant}

The L-functions and Modular Forms Database (LMFDB) project originated
at a meeting at The American Institute for Mathematics (AIM) in 2007.
L-functions are ubiquitous in number theory, and have applications to
mathematical physics and cryptography. The simplest example of an
L-functions is the Riemann zeta function. Two of the seven Clay
Mathematics Million Dollar Millennium Problems deal with properties of
these functions, namely the Riemann Hypothesis and the Birch and
Swinnerton-Dyer Conjecture, that were conjectured following computational exploration.  
As well as providing a central repository
of data as a resource for researchers, through its website
\url{www.lmfdb.org}, the LMFDB provides a modern handbook, including
tables, formulas, links and references, concerning particular specific
L-functions and their sources.  Between 2008 and 2012 the LMFDB was
funded through a US National Science Foundation (NSF) Focussed
Research Grant (FRG) of around \$1M.  Since 2013, the funding of the
LMFDB has passed to Europe through a six year £2.2M Programme Grant
from the UK Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council
(EPSRC), held at the universities of Warwick and Bristol, with
Professor John Cremona (Warwick) as its Principal Investigator (see
\url{http://www2.warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/maths/people/staff/john_cremona/lmf}).
This grant supports six three-year postdoctoral research fellows,
mathematical researchers who work on the mathematical aspects of the
project full-time, biannual workshops, equipment and a portion of the
investigators' own time.

Almost all contributors to the LMFDB project, including those directly
supported by the EPSRC grant and the larger world-wide team of 30-50
contributors of data and code, are pure mathematicians.  Most of these
have good computational skills, but are not professional programmers
or software developers.  The LMFDB has a great need to broaden the
support it can call upon from software developers, to enhance the
project in several ways, including the computation of number-theoretic
data but more specifically in supporting the database management and
website user interface, in order to make the data more accessible and
useful to others.  The codebase of the LMFDB project is entirely open
source and hosted at github (https://github.com/LMFDB/lmfdb), written
in python with specialist modules such as flask and pymongo to manage
the website and database interface, and \Sage\ for higher-level
mathematical computations.  The LMFDB project would therefore benefit
greatly from collaboration with \TheProject as it would connect the
project with a pool of experts.  Joint workshops between the LMFDB and
\TheProject will stimulate and develop such collaboration: the LMFDB
places great importance on its workshops, which are small gatherings
of around 30 invited participants who work throughout one week on
certain specific aspects of the project, coming together in plenary
sessions to make decisions, plan and collectively approve of proposed
developments.  As a leading example of the use of databases in
mathematical research, the LMFDB will provide \TheProject\ with a real
large-scale prototype around which to develop new ideas about the
design and implementation of such databases and their associated
software.  The feasibility of such collaboration was successfully
tried at a workshop at the ICMS in Edinburgh in January 2013 on
``Online databases: from L-functions to combinatorics'', sponsored by
the NSF, AIM and the ICMS.

As in the {\sc{Sage}} community, networking measures include the regular exchange 
of developers and the regular organization of software workshops (coding sprints) which 
bring whole teams together for solution finding and intense code writing. Particular tight 
collaborations exist between the {\sc{GAP}} and the {\sc{Singular}} communities, with 
major {\sc{GAP-Singular}} developers meetings taking alternately place at St. Andrews,
Kaiserslautern, and Aachen. See \url{http://www.computeralgebra.de/}.

\eucommentary{
If you have entered any ethics issues in the ethical issue table in the administrative proposal forms, you must:\\
$\bullet$ submit an ethics self-assessment, which: \\
-- describes how the proposal meets the national legal and ethical requirements of the
country or countries where the tasks raising ethical issues are to be carried out;\\
-- explains in detail how you intend to address the issues in the ethical issues table, in
particular as regards:
research objectives (e.g. study of vulnerable populations, dual use, etc.),
research methodology (e.g. clinical trials, involvement of children and related
consent procedures, protection of any data collected, etc.),
the potential impact of the research (e.g. dual use issues, environmental damage,
stigmatisation of particular social groups, political or financial retaliation,
benefit-sharing, malevolent use , etc.)\\
$\bullet$ provide the documents that you need under national law(if you already have them), e.g.:\\
-- an ethics committee opinion;\\
-- the document notifying activities raising ethical issues or authorising such activities\\
If these documents are not in English, you must also submit an English summary of them
(containing, if available, the conclusions of the committee or authority concerned).\\
If you plan to request these documents specifically for the project
you are proposing, your request must contain an explicit reference to the project title}
