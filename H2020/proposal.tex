\section{Excellence}

The focus of \TheProject is on promoting community-developed open
source software, databases, and services adapted to the needs of
collaborative research in pure mathematics and applications.

It will consolidate Europe's leading position in computational
mathematics and build on the remarkable success of the ecosystem of
projects like \GAP, \Python, \Sage, \Pari, \Singular, \LMFDB.



\subsection{Objectives}
\label{sect:objectives}

\eucommentary{1-2 pages}
\eucommentary{\emph{Describe the specific objectives for the project,
which should be clear, measurable, realistic and achievable within the
duration of the project. Objectives should be consistent with the expected
exploitation and impact of the project (see section 2).}}




\begin{enumerate}[\textbf{Aim} 1:]
\item \label{aim:collaboration} Improve the productivity of
  researchers by promoting collaborations on Mathematical
  \emph{software}, \emph{data}, and \emph{knowledge}.
\item \label{aim:vre} Make it easy for small to large teams of
  researchers to setup custom collaborative Virtual Research
  Environments adapted to their needs and workflow, supporting the
  entire life-cycle of computational work in mathematical research,
  from initial exploration to publication and teaching.
  % and bridge the gaps between
  % code, published results, and educational material.
\item \label{aim:sharing} Enable reproducible research and promote
  \TODO{dissemination, easier access, reuse, sharing ...}
\end{enumerate}


\TODO{make those into concrete objectives}

Our research will cover a wide variety of aspects, ranging from
software development models, user interfaces \TODO{virtual
  environments?}, deployment frameworks and novel collaborative tools,
component architecture, design, and standardization of software
\TODO{system?} and databases, to links to publication, data archival
and reproducibility of experiments, development models and tools, and
social aspects.


The concrete objectives of \TheProject are:
\begin{enumerate}[\textbf{Objective} 1:]
\item\label{objectives:tools} To provide interoperable collaborative
  open source tools for research in Mathematics that can be combined
  with off-the shelf non-mathematical infrastructure 
  into Virtual Research Environments running on a variety of
  platforms, including standard e-infrastructures. This fulfills part of
  Aim~\ref{aim:collaboration} and~\ref{aim:vre}

\TODO{Maybe split this into framework -- basically a collection of
  APIs and an initial core set of components}

\TODO{Urgent talk to EPCC re e-infrastructure standards}

\item Community building

  Bring together the communities (IPython, \Sage, \Singular)
\item Update existing components for seamless deployment and efficient
  execution on a wide range of computing environments (workstation,
  HPC, cloud). This fulfills part of Aim~\ref{aim:vre}.

  % Our tools will span the entire life-cycle of a research idea, . They will. This
  % project is based on existing, proven open source technologies
  % developed by our team over the last decade that have been widely
  % adopted in academia and industry.
\item Demonstrate the effectiveness of Virtual Research Environment
  built on top of \TheProject components for a number of real-world
  use cases taken from different domains.
\item Explore the social aspects: how do researchers collaborate in
  Mathematics? What can be the role of Virtual Research Environments?
\item Identify and promote software development best practices that will
  ensure the long term sustainability of an ecosystem of interoperable
  open source components,  developed by overlapping communities.


%Long term sustainability
\item Effective Dissemination
\end{enumerate}

\ref{objectives:tools}

\TODO{The pieces of material below need to be recombined in a flowing
  story.}

\subsubsection{Key ideas}:
\begin{itemize}
\item Experimental maths has become a core asset for research in pure
  mathematics and its applications.
\item Over the last decades, mathematicians have gained strong
  experience in collaborative software development, with pioneering
  work and continuing leadership of Europe.
\item Mathematicians have a strong tradition of sharing knowledge
  openly (arxiv, Wikipedia, ...).
\item Mathematicians have been building and sharing databases for a
  long while; the needs for such is growing tremendously, and the
  process needs to be streamlined.
\end{itemize}


This project gathers European core developers of leading mathematical
software (GAP, Pari, Sage, Singular, ...), databases (LMFDB, ...), and
critical components (IPython stack), together with researchers in
computer and social sciences, with mission to promote a new generation
of community-developed open source software \TODO{more precisely
  what's new is the combination thereof!}, databases, and services,
adapted to the needs of collaborative research in pure mathematics and
its applications.

\TODO{Keyword: flexible virtual environment}

\includegraphics[width=.6\textwidth]{Pictures/TheBigPicture.jpg}

Our research will cover a wide variety of aspects, ranging from
software development models, user interfaces \TODO{virtual
  environments?}  deployment frameworks and novel collaborative tools,
component architecture, design, and standardization of software
components and databases, to links to publication, data archival and
reproducibility of experiments, development models and tools, and
social aspects. It will build on the remarkable success of the open
source ecosystem and consolidate Europe's leading position in
computational mathematics.

Following the call specifications, all software, data, and
publications resulting from this proposal will be open.

\subsubsection{Why collaborative development of open source software?}

From their early days, computers have been used in pure mathematics,
either to prove theorems or, like the telescope for astronomers, to
explore new theories. Major achievements include the proof of the four
color theorem or \TODO{Nice flashy example?}. Usage has grown to the
point that certain areas of mathematics now completely depend on
experimental methods, with major efforts spent on software
development. As the sophistication of the required computations
increased, supported by the boom of the available computational power,
it became vital to share those efforts at the scale of large research
communities. European mathematicians have been pioneers and have grown
a steady tradition of collaborative open source software development,
with systems like GAP, Singular, or Pari/GP playing a major role for
decades.

\subsubsection{Importance of experimental tools in maths}

The field of computer algebra allows us to compute in and with a multitude
of mathematical structures. It is interdisciplinary in nature, with links to quite
a number of areas in mathematics, with applications in mathematics and other
branches of science and engineering, and with constantly new and often
surprising developments. Quite a number of these developments, in fact the
creation of whole subareas of the field,  have been iniated by European
researchers who made crucial contributions at all levels. These include the
design of fundamental algorithms, the development of major computer
algebra systems, applications of the computational methods in various fields,
and the creation of widely used databases.

Particular fruitful interactions unfold between computer algebra and
algebraic geometry, number theory, and group theory. Algebraic algorithms
open up new ways of accessing subareas of these key disciplines of
mathematics, and they are fundamental to practical applications of the
disciplines. Conversely, challenges arising in algebraic geometry, number
theory, and group theory quite often lead to algorithmic breakthroughs
which, in turn, open the door for new theoretical and practical applications
of computer algebra.

Based on exact computer aided calculations, the experimental method has
now been added to the toolbox of the pure mathematician. Experiments
lead to new conjectures which may have a deep impact on the future
development of mathematics. An outstanding example is the Birch and
Swinnerton-Dyer conjecture which is one of the Clay Millenium Problems.
Databases relying on computer calculations such as the Small Groups
Library or the Modular Atlas in group and representation theory provide
indispensible tools for researchers. A constructive way of understanding
proofs of deep theorems yields algorithmic tools to deal with highly abstract
concepts. These tools make the concepts available to a broader class of
researchers, with many potential applications. A prominent example from
algebraic geometry is the desingularization theorem of Hironaka, for which
Hironaka won the Fields Medal, and its algorithmization by Villamayor.

Spectacular theoretical breakthrougs such as Wiles' proof of Fermat's last
theorem are based on interdisciplinary approaches. Current developments
on the algorithmic side allow one to conquer crossconnections between
different areas of mathematics also computationally and, thus, to
arrive at cutting-edge applications which previously were inconceivable.

\paragraph{DFG Priority Project SPP 1489}
\url{computeralgebra.de}

\TOWRITE{WD}{Summarize the DFG Priority project description below into a paragraph}

The field of computer algebra allows one to compute in and with a
multitude of mathematical structures. It is interdisciplinary in
nature, with links to quite a number of areas in mathematics, with
applications in mathematics and other branches of science, and with
constantly new and often surprising developments.

Particular fruitful interactions unfold between computer algebra and
algebraic geometry, number theory, and group theory. Algebraic
algorithms open up new ways of accessing subareas of these key
disciplines of mathematics, and they are fundamental to practical
applications of the disciplines. Conversely, challenges arising in
algebraic geometry, number theory, and group theory quite often lead
to algorithmic breakthroughs which, in turn, open the door for new
theoretical and practical applications of computer algebra.

The goal of the DFG Priority Program SPP 1489 is to considerably
further the algorithmic and experimental methods in the afore
mentioned disciplines, to combine the different methods where needed,
and to apply them to central questions in theory and praxis. Moreover,
the programme is meant to support the further development of free
computer algebra systems which are (co-)based in Germany, and which in
the framework of different projects, may require crosslinking on
different levels.

Of particular interest are interactions with application areas inside
and outside of mathematics such as system- and control theory, coding
theory, cryptography, CAD, algebraic combinatorics, and algebraic
statistics as well as hybrid methods which combine numerical and
symbolic approaches.

\TOWRITE{WD}{One paragraph description of how this relates to this project}

\paragraph{IPython/Jupyter grant from the Alfred P. Sloan foundation}
\TOWRITE{IPython}{Proofread description of the Sloan grant and link to this project}

The IPython project received a \$1.15M grant from the Alfred P. Sloan
foundation that is supporting IPython development for two years
(1/1/2013-12/31/2014), in particular at the University of California,
Berkeley and California Polytechnic State University, San Luis Obispo.
This grant enabled the project to focus on developing the IPython
Notebook as a general tool for scientific and technical computing that
is open, collaborative and reproducible. This goes a long way toward
Aim \TODO{... and ...} of \TheProject, especially given the current
rapid evolution of IPython toward its language agnostic avatar
Jupyter.

\TheProject will build on the outcome of the Sloan grant, and further
develop the critical IPython/Jupyter component in close collaboration
with the IPython/Jupyter team. In particular, we plan to hire some of
the European developers that are currently funded by the Sloan grant
to work in California and wish to later return to Europe.

\paragraph{LMFDB grant}

The L-functions and Modular Forms Database (LMFDB) project originated
at a meeting at The American Institute for Mathematics (AIM) in 2007.
L-functions are ubiquitous in number theory, and have applications to
mathematical physics and cryptography. The simplest example of an
L-functions is the Riemann zeta function. Two of the seven Clay
Mathematics Million Dollar Millennium Problems deal with properties of
these functions, namely the Riemann Hypothesis and the Birch and
Swinnerton-Dyer Conjecture.  As well as providing a central repository
of data as a resource for researchers, through its website
\url{www.lmfdb.org}, the LMFDB provides a modern handbook, including
tables, formulas, links and references, concerning particular specific
L-functions and their sources.  Between 2008 and 2012 the LMFDB was
funded through a US National Science Foundation (NSF) Focussed
Research Grant (FRG) of around \$1M.  Since 2013, the funding of the
LMFDB has passed to Europe through a six year £2.2M Programme Grant
from the UK Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council
(EPSRC), held at the universities of Warwick and Bristol, with
Professor John Cremona (Warwick) as its Principal Investigator (see
\url{http://www2.warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/maths/people/staff/john_cremona/lmf}).
This grant supports six three-year postdoctoral research fellows,
mathematical researchers who work on the mathematical aspects of the
project full-time, biannual workshops, equipment and a portion of the
investigators' own time.

Almost all contributors to the LMFDB project, including those directly
supported by the EPSRC grant and the larger world-wide team of 30-50
contributors of data and code, are pure mathematicians.  Most of these
have good computational skills, but are not professional programmers
or software developers.  The LMFDB has a great need to broaden the
support it can call upon from software developers, to enhance the
project in several ways, including the computation of number-theoretic
data but more specifically in supporting the database management and
website user interface, in order to make the data more accessible and
useful to others.  The codebase of the LMFDB project is entirely open
source and hosted at github (https://github.com/LMFDB/lmfdb), written
in python with specialist modules such as flask and pymongo to manage
the website and database interface, and Sage for higher-level
mathematical computations.  The LMFDB project would therefore benefit
greatly from collaboration with \TheProject as it would
connect the project with a pool of experts.  Joint workshops between
the LMFDB and \TheProject will stimulate and develop such
collaboration: the LMFDB places great importance on its workshops,
which are small gatherings of around 30 invited participants who work
throughout one week on certain specific aspects of the project, coming
together in plenary sessions to make decisions, plan and collectively
approve of proposed developments.

\subsection{Measures to Maximise Impact}

\subsubsection{Dissemination and Exploitation of Results}
\label{subsubsect:dissemination}

\eucommentary{-- Provide a draft 'plan for the dissemination and exploitation
of the project's results'. The plan, which should be proportionate to the
scale of the project, should contain measures to be implemented both during
and after the project.\\
Dissemination and exploitation measures should address the full range
of potential users and uses including research, commercial, investment,
social, environmental, policy making, setting standards, skills and
educational training.\\
The approach to innovation should be as comprehensive as possible,
and must be tailored to the specific technical, market and organisational
issues to be addressed\\
-- Explain how the proposed measures will help to achieve the expected impact of the
project . Provide a draft business plan for financial sustainability as stated in the Part
E of the Specific features for Research Infrastructures of the Horizon 2020 European
Research Infrastructures (including e-Infrastructures) Work Programme 2014-2015.\\
-- Where relevant, include information on how the participants will
manage the research data generated and/or collected during the
project, in particular addressing the following issues:
What types of data will the project generate/collect? What
standards will be used? How will this data be exploited and/or
shared/made accessible for verification and re-use (If data cannot
be made available, explain why)? How will this data be curated and preserved?\\ \\
-- Include information about any open source software used or developed by the
project.\\
You will need an appropriate consortium agreement to manage (amongst other things)
the ownership and access to key knowledge (IPR, data etc.). Where relevant,
these will allow you, collectively and individually, to pursue market opportunities
arising from the project's results.\\
The appropriate structure of the consortium to support exploitation is addressed
in section 3.3. \\ \\
-- Outline the strategy for knowledge management and protection. Include measures to
provide open access (free on-line access, such as the ``green'' or ``gold'' model) to
peer-reviewed scientific publications which might result from the project.\\
Open access publishing (also called 'gold' open access) means that an article is
immediately provided in open access mode by the scientific publisher. The associated costs
are usually shifted away from readers, and instead (for example) to the university or
research institute to which the researcher is affiliated, or to the funding agency supporting
the research.\\
Self-archiving (also called ``green'' open access) means that the published article or the
final peer-reviewed manuscript is archived by the researcher - or a representative - in an
online repository before, after or alongside its publication. Access to this article is often -
but not necessarily - delayed (``embargo period''), as some scientific publishers may wish to
recoup their investment by selling subscriptions and charging pay-per-download/view fees
during an exclusivity period.}


\paragraph{Long term sustainability}

The success of large specialized software like Pari, Singular or GAP
in the last decades has shown the viability of the academic open
source development model for such. For a long time, it was bitterly
debated whether this model would have any chance to scale to general
purpose systems for pure mathematics. The rapid take off of Sage in
the last 10 years has proven the viability of the ``developed by users
for users'' model: despite its large community of 300 developers, it's
running on a tiny specific budget, with most activities being funded
indirectly by research grants that require specific development.

This was made possibly by reusing existing components whenever
possible (e.g. hundreds of specialized open source math libraries, or
the Python programming language with its developers tools and huge
library), and outsourcing software development (e.g. the Cython
compiler) to larger communities whenever possible.

\TODO{This piece of argument is tricky to setup!!!}

Yet, long term critical non mathematical features like portability,
modularization, packaging, user interfaces, large data, parallelism,
or outreach toward related software, have been lagging behind. Indeed
they can hardly be implemented as a side product of research projects,
and \textbf{need to be assigned to full time developers}. Regular
funding is also needed to better structure the computational
mathematics community in Europe and support its upcoming major
widening through training, development workshops, exchanges, ...

The purpose of this grant is to initiate this process. The principle
is that, with the growth of the user base, a tiny number of
institutions or companies will hire a single full-time developer, and
this will be sufficient because they critically need it to support
their research.

The number of such required full time developers will be made even
tinier because most of the efforts now will be focused toward
outsourcing more components to reduce the recurrent needs.

For example, this project will save much recurrent efforts to the
mathematics community by outsourcing the development of the user
interface to IPython. This grant will provide the required temporary
boost to make IPython stand to the stringent needs of the community.
Later on, thanks to its large user base, both in academia and
industry, IPython will continue to thrive without specific funding or
major contributions from the mathematics community.

Another big focus of this project will be on the study of open source
development models for mathematical software and how they can be made
more productive, in particular by better processes and collaboration
between components, which will also reduce the number of required full
time developers.

\draftpage

\subsubsection{Communication activities}
\label{subsubsect:communication}

\eucommentary{Describe the proposed communication measures for promoting the
project and its findings during the period of the grant. Where appropriate
these measures should include social media and public events with user
participation. Measures should be proportionate to the scale of the project,
with clear objectives. They should be tailored to the needs of various audiences,
including groups beyond the project's own community. Where relevant, include
measures for public/societal engagement on issues related to the project.}

\subsection{Ethics}

\eucommentary{
If you have entered any ethics issues in the ethical issue table in the administrative proposal forms, you must:\\
$\bullet$ submit an ethics self-assessment, which: \\
-- describes how the proposal meets the national legal and ethical requirements of the
country or countries where the tasks raising ethical issues are to be carried out;\\
-- explains in detail how you intend to address the issues in the ethical issues table, in
particular as regards:
research objectives (e.g. study of vulnerable populations, dual use, etc.),
research methodology (e.g. clinical trials, involvement of children and related
consent procedures, protection of any data collected, etc.),
the potential impact of the research (e.g. dual use issues, environmental damage,
stigmatisation of particular social groups, political or financial retaliation,
benefit-sharing, malevolent use , etc.)\\
$\bullet$ provide the documents that you need under national law(if you already have them), e.g.:\\
-- an ethics committee opinion;\\
-- the document notifying activities raising ethical issues or authorising such activities\\
If these documents are not in English, you must also submit an English summary of them
(containing, if available, the conclusions of the committee or authority concerned).\\
If you plan to request these documents specifically for the project
you are proposing, your request must contain an explicit reference to the project title}

\subsection{Security}

Please indicate if your proposal will involve:

\begin{itemize}
\item
activities or results raising security issues: NO
\item
'EU-classified information' as background or results: NO
