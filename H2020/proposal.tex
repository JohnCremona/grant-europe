\paragraph{Objective~\ref{objective:framework}: Virtual Research
  Environment Kit}\ 

Computational techniques have become a core asset for research in pure
mathematics and its applications in the last decades. Mathematics
communities have come together to develop powerful computational
tools, such as GAP, \PariGP, \Sage or Singular, and valuable on-line
services such as the Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences (OEIS
\url{http://oeis.org}) and the ATLAS of Finite Group Representations
\url{http://brauer.maths.qmul.ac.uk/Atlas/v3/}. In building these
systems, mathematicians have gained strong experience in collaborative
software development, with pioneering work and continuing leadership
in Europe.

A number of approaches to linking these resources have been developed,
such as the SCSCP protocol from the Framework 6 SCIEnce project, and
the incorporation of a variety of free software tools in the \Sage 
system, but the overall model is still that of a single mathematician
running programs or interacting with a ``notebook''
page. The software provides little or no support for other aspects of
mathematical research: collaboration,
archival, reproducibility or linkage between programs, data and
publication. Databases are updated mainly by mathematicians directly,
retaining no record of the source of new entries, and providing no way
of referring to the actual version of the data used in a particular
computation.

The first objective of this project is to \emph{design an architecture} which
will allow existing mathematical software systems (suitably updated), 
off-the shelf non-mathematical tools and a small number of new
components to be flexibly combined to produce a VRE that will
effectively support collaborative mathematical research throughout
its entire life-cycle. This will include software APIs and standards,
and frameworks for assuring the semantic consistency of similar
mathematical objects in different systems.  It will be informed by the
outputs of Objective \ref{objective:social}, ensuring that the VREs
fit the ways that mathematicians actually work.

\TODO{Keyword: flexible/versatile virtual environment. Does this
  belong here}

Our research will cover a wide variety of aspects, ranging from
software development models, user interfaces, virtual
environments, deployment frameworks and novel collaborative tools,
component architecture, design, and standardization of software
components and databases, to links to publication, data archival and
reproducibility of experiments, development models and tools, and
social aspects. It will build on the remarkable success of the open
source ecosystem and consolidate Europe's leading position in
computational mathematics.

Following the call specifications, all software, data, and
publications resulting from this proposal will be open.



\paragraph{Objective~\ref{objectives:core}: Core components}\

Most of the direct mathematical capabilities of our software will come
from existing or updated open source mathematical systems. For instance we will
use the power of the \GAP Library for computational group theory or
\PariGP for number theory. Generic services such as storage, version
control, authentication and resource accounting will come from
off-the-shelf components building on standard infrastructures.

Nevertheless, some \emph{new tools} will need to be developed or
adapted. One example is a general infrastructure for mathematical
databases, covering some of the types of data values and search
criteria common in mathematics, but rare outside, and issues such as
provenance and citation that are common to most mathematical
databases. Other examples include adapting user interface and
collaboration tools to support mathematical notation.




\paragraph{Objective~\ref{objective:community}: Community building across disciplines}\ 


Open source tools are developed with great effect across different
communities often leading to re-inventions and re-implementations of
great ideas by different people not being aware of each other's work. By
\emph{fostering a more cross-discipline community}, by \emph{sharing tools where
possible} and by \emph{creating generic tools} that can be shared,
we will reduce such duplication of effort significantly. This will
also lead to better quality software, as the maintenance and
development effort can be focused on one tool rather than a wide
spread of codes, allow sharing of innovative ideas and practice more
efficiently, and substantially increasing productivity of research.

While each of the communities such as the developers of \Sage, \Singular, and \GAP need
somewhat special features for their research, they are united through
being (i)~focussed on mathematical challenges, and (ii)~needing a
computational workflow. \IPython and the \Jupyter Notebook are used
widely in communities outside mathematics in Science and Engineering
that also need the computational workflow and are based on
(iii)~applications of mathematics. These three common attributes are
sufficient to distill the requirements for core features of the
virtual research environment described in this
proposal. Community building will also help to sustain ongoing and
community driven maintenance of a such a tool.



\paragraph{Objective~\ref{objective:updates}: Updates to Mathematical
  Software components}\
Essential to our vision is leveraging the community's massive
decades-long investment in a range of open source mathematical
software systems. These systems are complex, widely used and powerful,
but generally designed for operation as stand-alone programs, not as
part of an integrated VRE. Many are also not well-suited for modern
platforms, needing work to better support parallel programming,
virtualization and HPC platforms. We will \emph{update these systems to work
together} seamlessly and comply with best practice for portability and
platform integration.


\paragraph{Objective~\ref{objective:sustainable}: A sustainable
  ecosystem of software components}\ 

The success of large specialized software like \PariGP, \Singular or
\GAP in the last decades has shown the viability of the academic open
source development model. For a long time, it was bitterly
debated whether this model would be able to scale to general
purpose systems for pure mathematics. The rapid takeoff of Sage in the
last decade has proven the viability of the ``developed by users for
users'' model: despite its large international community of about 150
active developers, it runs on a tiny specific budget, with most
activities being funded indirectly by research grants that require
specific development.

This has been made possible by reusing existing components wherever
possible (including hundreds of specialized open source math libraries and
the \Python programming language, with its developers' tools and huge
library), by spinning off software development (e.g. the \Cython
compiler) to larger communities whenever possible, and by carefully
designing the development workflow.

Yet, long-term critical non-mathematical features such as portability,
modularization, packaging, user interfaces, large data, parallelism,
or outreach toward related software, have lagged behind. Indeed,
they can hardly be implemented as a side product of research projects,
and \emph{need to be assigned to a few full time developers}. Regular
funding is also needed to better structure the computational
mathematics community in Europe, and support its upcoming major
widening through training, development workshops and interdisciplinary exchanges.

\emph{One purpose of this grant is to initiate this process and
  invest in the long term to reduce recurrent needs.}

The principle is that, with the growth of the user base, a tiny number
of institutions or companies will hire full-time developers to
support the critical needs of their in-house research or development.
Opportunities for such hiring are, for example, actively investigated at
the Laboratoire de Recherche en Informatique. It should be noted that,
at the scale of a large university, the cost of licenses for analogous
commercial software can reach the same order of magnitude as that of a
developer.

%\TODO{Examples: LRI? Full time devs supported by research grant, like
%  for Linbox? Others?}

To reduce the number of required full time developers \TheProject will
invest toward factoring out joint needs, and outsourcing or spinning
off more components to larger communities.
%
For example, \TheProject will save the mathematics community from
duplication of effort, by first outsourcing the development of the user
interface of each computational component to \Jupyter and make
\Jupyter stand up to the stringent needs of the community.  Later,
thanks to its large user base both in academia and industry, \Jupyter
will continue to thrive without specific funding or major
contributions from the mathematics community.

\TheProject will also foster the productivity within the ecosystem by
investigating better collaboration processes between components, and
identifying, sharing, and promoting software development best
practices.

% open source development models for
\paragraph{Objective~\ref{objective:social}: Engineering social interactions in open source VREs}\
Scientists interact in the process of scientific discovery in a variety of ways.
In particular, researchers in mathematics and adjacent theoretic disciplines often refer
to minds of collaborators as some sort of laboratories. With the advent of internet
the volume of scientific communication increased by orders of magnitude. Recent
successful massively collaborative online projects to attack mathematical 
problems, known as \emph{Polymath}, initiated by Gowers and Tao, were just not 
feasible 20 years ago, that is, before the WorldWideWeb era.
Social aspects of interactions of this type are currently being actively investigated.

In many ways the process of designing, development and maintenance of an open-source VRE, in which mathematics
and algorithms play a key role, closely resembles \emph{Polymath} efforts.
Thus \TheProject\ VRE is a perfect object to study, as there is plenty of data to analyse, and 
opportunity to tweak the development workflow to obtain more relevant data, if needed.

On the other hand, recently social aspects of interactions became a focus of attention
of a burgeoning field of \emph{algorithmic game theory}, which provides \emph{tools} to engineer 
environments where all participants are incentivised to contribute to the common good.
Finding an optimal way to allocate reputation scores to participants of
an online trading platform, such as Ebay, is just one of very many examples where
these tools are used. We will investigate optimal ways to allocate reputation scores to 
developers and users of on open source VRE for their contributions, to facilitate
the ``mutual crowdsourcing'' that is taking place as the VRE evolves, using the \TheProject\ VRE
as a testing ground.

Another set of tools deals with questions of stability of coalitions and
collective decision making.  These are applicable to the questions of stability of
the community of developers  of open source VREs---it is well-known that 
open source projects are often unstable: forks are created quite often,
developers leave, etc., 
which frequently results in a waste of resources.
We will investigate stability of \TheProject\ and ways of improving it using the  tools
of cooperative game theory. 



\paragraph{Objective~\ref{objective:data}: Next generation mathematical databases}\ 
Mathematics has a rich notion of data: it can be either
numeric or symbolic data; knowledge about mathematical objects given as
statements (definitions, theorems or proofs); or software that computes
with these mathematical objects.

All this data is really a commons, and should be maintained as
such. Much of this proposal, and the prior work of many of the experts
involved, is concerned with open source mathematical software, through
permissive licensing of their work.

The objective described here is to \emph{build infrastructure},
enabling mathematicians to collaboratively build this commons, while
fostering a virtuous circle of interoperability between these different
types of data: one mathematician might implement an algorithm, to be
run later on numerical data collected by another scientist.

\paragraph{Objective~\ref{objective:demo}: Collaborative Research Environments that Transcend Domains}\ 

\TOWRITE{NL}{Examples and references to the corresponding tasks?}

We will create a number of \emph{demonstrators} to highlight the power
of \TheProject{} (\taskref{UI}{structdocs}, \taskref{}{ibook}). The demonstrators will highlight the applicability
of \TheProject{} across mathematics, engineering and science. They
will act so as to provide recipes for state-of-the-art computational
infrastructure tools, and provide avenues for ensuring the
repeatability of mathematical analysis.

In particular, we will create a \emph{repository of interactive
 notebooks} across a range of application domains (e.g. engineering
mechanics, biology and physics). The notebooks will demonstrate a
variety of numerical and symbolic techniques in self-contained
executable documents. We expect these exemplars to feed in to
education at high schools and universities (both undergraduate and
postgraduate level). They will also provide a resource for outreach
and self-study.

Our demonstrator notebooks will also act as demonstrators of the
features developed in \TheProject. Having been incorporated and
developed by this project, they can be re-executed to serve both as a
regression test and to form part of the documentation of \TheProject.

%% We
%% will further develop notebook tools for a magnetic materials
%% simulation package to demonstrate the value of \TheProject{} for
%% leading edge computational science, and develop the corresponding
%% executable tutorials and documentation.


\paragraph{Objective~\ref{objective:disseminate}: Training and dissemination}\ 

The success of any research software or service is strongly linked to
its ability to attract and retain a large number of users. The
different communities (Sage, Gap, \PariGP, Singular, \Jupyter, ...)
have each developed sustainable networks. For example, Sage has
accumulated thousands of users in under 10 years. This has been
achieved thanks to a very strong community building philosophy,
especially through the organization of ``Sage-Days'' all over the
world. The first Sage-Days was held in 2006; to date there have been
at least 63 of them, including 10 during 2014, as well as Sage
Education days, Sage Bug days, Sage Doc days, Sage Days aimed
specifically at women, and more. Many of the \TheProject{} project
members have been involved in these events either as organizers or
participants, and are convinced that they are a most efficient way to
promote our software. More precisely, our objective is to create a
constant dialogue between the different communities, through frequent
workshops, conferences, user groups, and mailing lists. By building on
existing tools, we intend to involve the communities in the
development process itself in the spirit of open-source software.

We also intend to reach a larger crowd of researchers by minimising
technical (non-research) obstacles to access existing tools: building
better documentation and tutorials, developing easy-to-install
distributions, enabling easy web and cloud access, better user
interfaces, better interactions between different software.  We will
run a series of workshops to inject additional momentum into the
process. By doing this, our objective will be to \emph{help the
  communities to grow} themselves and interact together using our
work.

\TheProject mainly consists of developing independent tools and secondly
integrate them into a VRE. The independence of our tasks reflect this fact.

\paragraph{Work Programme for Objective 1: }

Objective 1 is covered by \WPref{component-architecture} (component architecture) but also depends
on \WPref{UI} (user interface) and \WPref{hpc} (HPC).

\paragraph{Work Programme for Objective 2: }

Core components of the VRE are developed with work packages~\WPref{component-architecture},
\WPref{hpc} \WPref{dksbases} (databases) and \WPref{UI}.

\paragraph{Work Programme for Objective 3: }

Different communities will be brought together within the workpackage~\WPref{component-architecture},
especially with~\taskref{component-architecture}{interface-systems} which aims to interface
various softwares. The Work package~\WPref{dissem} (dissemination) will also be the occasion
for concrete developer meeting from different horizons.

\paragraph{Work Programme for Objective 4: }

Individual softwares will be updated within work packages \WPref{component-architecture} and \WPref{hpc}.

\paragraph{Work Programme for Objective 5: }

A sustainable ecosystem should be reached
\WPref{component-architecture}, \WPref{dksbases}, \WPref{UI}, \WPref{hpc} 
This objective should also benefit from \WPref{social-aspects} (social aspects) with~\taskref{social-aspects}{decisionmaking}.

\paragraph{Work Programme for Objective 6: }

For Objective 6, we have a dedicated work package \WPref{social-aspects} on social aspects.
It ranges from analysis of the needs with~\taskref{social-aspects}{social-input} to
evaluation with~\taskref{social-aspects}{oommf-nb-evaluation}.

\paragraph{Work Programme for Objective 7: }

 \WPref{dksbases} 

\paragraph{Work Programme for Objective 8: }

\WPref{social-aspects} (social aspects), \WPref{dissem} (dissemination)

\paragraph{Work Programme for Objective 9: }

The effective dissemination is achieved with part of~\WPref{dissem}. More
specifically, members of \TheProject will organize workshops with \taskref{dissem}{dissemination}
or \taskref{project-intro}.

\subsection{Third Parties Involved in the Project (including use of third party resources)}

\eucommentary{Please complete, for each participant, the table
(see page 27 of "VRETemplate.PDF"),
or simply state "No third parties involved", if applicable.}

The University of Bordeaux will be involved as a third party. Geographically this will
be the same entity as CNRS Aquitaine, but it is needed to include staff from the university
(i.e. Karim Belabas and Adrien Boussicault).

No third parties involved.

\section{Ethics and Security}

\eucommentary{This section is not covered by the page limit.}

\subsection{Ethics}

\eucommentary{
If you have entered any ethics issues in the ethical issue table in the administrative proposal forms, you must:\\
$\bullet$ submit an ethics self-assessment, which: \\
-- describes how the proposal meets the national legal and ethical requirements of the
country or countries where the tasks raising ethical issues are to be carried out;\\
-- explains in detail how you intend to address the issues in the ethical issues table, in
particular as regards:
research objectives (e.g. study of vulnerable populations, dual use, etc.),
research methodology (e.g. clinical trials, involvement of children and related
consent procedures, protection of any data collected, etc.),
the potential impact of the research (e.g. dual use issues, environmental damage,
stigmatisation of particular social groups, political or financial retaliation,
benefit-sharing, malevolent use , etc.)\\
$\bullet$ provide the documents that you need under national law (if you already have them), e.g.:\\
-- an ethics committee opinion;\\
-- the document notifying activities raising ethical issues or authorizing such activities\\
If these documents are not in English, you must also submit an English summary of them
(containing, if available, the conclusions of the committee or authority concerned).\\
If you plan to request these documents specifically for the project
you are proposing, your request must contain an explicit reference to the project title}

\subsection{Security}

Please indicate if your proposal will involve:

\begin{itemize}
\item activities or results raising security issues: NO
\item 'EU-classified information' as background or results: NO
\end{itemize}
\end{proposal}
