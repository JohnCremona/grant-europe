\section{Excellence}

\subsection{Objectives}
\label{sect:objectives}


From their early days, computers have been used in pure mathematics,
either to prove theorems or, like the telescope for astronomers, to
explore new theories. Major achievements include the proof of the four
color theorem or ... Usage has grown to the point that certain areas
of mathematics now completely depend on experimental methods.



European mathematicians have been the early pioneers in the area, and
have grown a long tradition of collaborative open source software
development with systems like GAP, Singular, or Pari/GP playing a
major role for decades.

This project gathers developers of the leading mathematical software
in Europe and of key components, together with researchers in social
sciences, with mission to promote a new generation of
community-developed open source software, databases, and services
adapted to the needs of collaborative research in pure mathematics and
applications.

Our research will cover a wide variety of aspects, ranging from
software development models, user interfaces \TODO{virtual
  environments?}  deployment frameworks and novel collaborative tools,
component architecture, design, and standardization of software
\TODO{system?} and databases, to links to publication, data archival
and reproducibility of experiments, development models and tools, and
social aspects.

It will consolidate Europe's leading position in computational
mathematics and build on the remarkable success of the dynamic
Python/Sage ecosystem and its sister European projects (GAP, Pari,
Singular, LMFDB, ...).

explain how your proposal addresses the specific challenge and scope 
of that topic, as set out in the work programme.}

\draftpage

\subsection{Concept and Approach}

\eucommentary{
-- Describe and explain the overall concept underpinning the project. 
Describe the main ideas, models or assumptions involved. Identify 
any trans-disciplinary considerations;\\
-- Describe any national or international research and innovation activities which will be
linked with the project, especially where the outputs from these will feed into the
project;\\
-- Describe and explain the overall approach and methodology, distinguishing, as
appropriate, activities indicated in the relevant section of the work programme, e.g.
Networking Activities, Service Activities and Joint Research Activities, as detailed in
the Part E of the Specific features for Research Infrastructures of the Horizon 2020
European Research Infrastructures (including e-Infrastructures) Work Programme 2014-
2015;\\

improvements of the services provided by the infrastructures.\\
-- As per Part E of the Work Programme, where relevant, describe how the project will
share and use existing basic operations services (e.g. authorisation and accounting
systems, service registry, etc.) with other e-infrastructure providers and justify why such
services should be (re)developed if they already exist in other e-infrastructures. Describe
how the developed services will be discoverable on-line.\\

\section{Impact}
\label{sec:impact}

\subsection{Expected Impacts}

\eucommentary{Please be specific, and provide only information that applies 
to the proposal and its objectives. Wherever possible, use quantified 
indicators and targets.\\
Describe how your project will contribute to:\\
-- the expected impacts set out in the work programme, under the relevant topic
(including key performance indicators/metrics for monitoring results and impacts);\\
-- improving innovation capacity and the integration of new knowledge 
(strengthening the competitiveness and growth of companies by developing 
innovations meeting the needs of European and global markets; and, where 
relevant, by delivering such innovations to the markets;\\
-- any other environmental and socially important impacts (if not already 
covered above).\\
Describe any barriers/obstacles, and any framework conditions (such as 
regulation and standards), that may determine whether and to what extent 
the expected impacts will be achieved. (This should not include any risk 
factors concerning implementation, as covered in section 3.2.)}

\draftpage

\subsection{Measures to Maximise Impact}

\subsubsection{Dissemination and Exploitation of Results}
\label{subsubsect:dissemination}

\eucommentary{-- Provide a draft 'plan for the dissemination and exploitation 
of the project's results'. The plan, which should be proportionate to the 
scale of the project, should contain measures to be implemented both during 
and after the project.\\
Dissemination and exploitation measures should address the full range 
of potential users and uses including research, commercial, investment, 
social, environmental, policy making, setting standards, skills and 
educational training.\\
The approach to innovation should be as comprehensive as possible, 
and must be tailored to the specific technical, market and organisational 
issues to be addressed\\
-- Explain how the proposed measures will help to achieve the expected impact of the
project . Provide a draft business plan for financial sustainability as stated in the Part
E of the Specific features for Research Infrastructures of the Horizon 2020 European
Research Infrastructures (including e-Infrastructures) Work Programme 2014-2015.\\
-- Where relevant, include information on how the participants will 
manage the research data generated and/or collected during the 
project, in particular addressing the following issues: 
What types of data will the project generate/collect? What 
standards will be used? How will this data be exploited and/or 
shared/made accessible for verification and re-use (If data cannot 
be made available, explain why)? How will this data be curated and preserved?\\ \\
-- Include information about any open source software used or developed by the
project.\\
You will need an appropriate consortium agreement to manage (amongst other things) 
the ownership and access to key knowledge (IPR, data etc.). Where relevant, 
these will allow you, collectively and individually, to pursue market opportunities
arising from the project's results.\\
The appropriate structure of the consortium to support exploitation is addressed 
in section 3.3. \\ \\
-- Outline the strategy for knowledge management and protection. Include measures to
provide open access (free on-line access, such as the �green� or �gold� model) to
peer-reviewed scientific publications which might result from the project.\\
Open access publishing (also called 'gold' open access) means that an article is
immediately provided in open access mode by the scientific publisher. The associated costs
are usually shifted away from readers, and instead (for example) to the university or
research institute to which the researcher is affiliated, or to the funding agency supporting
the research.\\
Self-archiving (also called 'green' open access) means that the published article or the
final peer-reviewed manuscript is archived by the researcher - or a representative - in an
online repository before, after or alongside its publication. Access to this article is often -
but not necessarily - delayed (�embargo period�), as some scientific publishers may wish to
recoup their investment by selling subscriptions and charging pay-per-download/view fees
during an exclusivity period.}

\draftpage

\subsubsection{Communication activities}
\label{subsubsect:communication}

\eucommentary{Describe the proposed communication measures for promoting the 
project and its findings during the period of the grant. Where appropriate 
these measures should include social media and public events with user 
participation. Measures should be proportionate to the scale of the project, 
with clear objectives. They should be tailored to the needs of various audiences, 
including groups beyond the project's own community. Where relevant, include 
measures for public/societal engagement on issues related to the project.}

the potential impact of the research (e.g. dual use issues, environmental damage,
stigmatisation of particular social groups, political or financial retaliation,
benefit-sharing, malevolent use , etc.)\\
$\bullet$ provide the documents that you need under national law(if you already have them), e.g.:\\
