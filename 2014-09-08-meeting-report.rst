Collaborative ecosystems for mathematical research and software development

Mission statement for the grant
-------------------------------

Our mission is to promote a new generation of community-developed open
source software, databases, and services adapted to the needs of
collaborative research in pure mathematics and applications

Our research will cover a wide variety of aspects, ranging from
software development models, user interfaces (virtual environments?),
deploymemnt frameworks and novel collaborative tools, component
architecture, design, and standardization of software (system?) and
databases, to links to publication, data archival and reproducibility
of experiments, development models and tools, and social aspects.

It will consolidate Europe's leading position in computational
mathematics and build on the remarkable success of the dynamic
Python/SAGE ecosystem and sister European projects (GAP, Pari,
Singular, LMFDB, ...).
