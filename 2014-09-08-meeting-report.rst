The meeting started by making a list of needs for every participant, and
it was felt strongly that all of these might not fit well into the H2020 call
in question, and it might be better to split the effort, namely, 
to simultaneously apply for the H2020 VRE grant, and for the `COST network
grant <http://www.cost.eu/domains_actions/ict>`_.

Proposed COST network
---------------------

The latter shall meet "small" needs, such as funding for
travel/visits/Sage days/other meetings quite well, and allow
to cover a wider network of EU sites.
Tentavively the proposal is going to be prepared by Dima and Marco.


H2020 VRE grant application
---------------------------

It was felt that Nicolas/community vision for the VRE grant was way 
too technical and Sage-centric, and had no chance of fitting into the
grant call. Steve Linton presented his vision of an application, much
more fitting into the call, and we worked out a `merge <WorkPackages.rst>`_ of the two visions.

Two important points of departure are

* introduction of a *social* component into the project, investigating
how the interaction within open-source collaborative development of
mathematical software happens. The corresponding work packages are to be
coordinated by `Ursula Martin <http://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/people/ursula.martin/>`_ (Oxford).
* "abstracting" the work packages, making them less Sage technicalities-
centric, and more fitting into the grant call.

The consortium structure was discussed and roughly decided upon (see below). It will be a
relatively small group of sites, with more than one active person per
site, with substantial project-related activities going. (Also important
due to a significant administrative overhead imposed on each site).
Given the shift in scope, it was felt that Steve should become the
overall administrative lead, while Nicolas remain responsible for
the Sage-related technical matters of the grant.


Further, we worked on `punchlines <PunchLines.rst>`_ for the proposal, 
a tentative title was chosen, and a draft mission statement written (see below).


Grant title

Collaborative ecosystems for mathematical research and software development

Mission statement for the grant
-------------------------------

Our mission is to promote a new generation of community-developed open
source software, databases, and services adapted to the needs of
collaborative research in pure mathematics and applications

Our research will cover a wide variety of aspects, ranging from
software development models, user interfaces (virtual environments?),
deploymemnt frameworks and novel collaborative tools, component
architecture, design, and standardization of software (system?) and
databases, to links to publication, data archival and reproducibility
of experiments, development models and tools, and social aspects.

It will consolidate Europe's leading position in computational
mathematics and build on the remarkable success of the dynamic
Python/SAGE ecosystem and sister European projects (GAP, Pari,
Singular, LMFDB, ...).
