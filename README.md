Grant application files for a potential European H2020 grant around Sage
========================================================================

At the occasion of a presentation of the European H2020 call for
grants, I (Nicolas M. Thiéry) started discussing opportunities for
Sage with Eugénia Shadlova (in charge of European projects at
Université Paris-Sud) and Jean-Pierre Caminade (research
infrastructure mission in the french research ministry). From those
discussions, it seems a good bet could be the call EINFRA-9:
e-Infrastructure for Virtual Research Environment. The time line would
be a submission in January 2015, with funding starting 8 months after
the submission.

So now is a good time to start thinking about it. This in particular
since the French CNRS INS2I institute is offering support (up to 5000
euros) for preparing such proposals, with an application deadline on
the 21st (this Friday!). This money could be used e.g. to organize a
Sage-Days this year geared toward this grant (and real work too!).

European H2020 calls concern countries in Europe as well as associated
countries and third countries as listed
[there](http://ec.europa.eu/research/participants/docs/h2020-funding-guide/cross-cutting-issues/international-cooperation_en.htm). Just
to mention a couple where I can think of Sage developers and users
from the top of my head, this includes e.g. Switzerland, Israel,
Senegal, or South Africa.

If you would tentatively be interested in joining as a participant,
PI, or even better lead PI, please get in touch with me (nthiery at
users.sf.net) at any time, specifying:

- trac & github account if you have them
- Name, e-mail
- Status, institute (I can derive that from the main page of
  trac.sagemath.org if the information there is up to date)

I have setup this git project for this would-be proposal. A mailing
list is coming too. I will add all the participants there so that they
can start editing the information.

The draft of project grew up from previous attempts at the scale of
Sage-Combinat in France; there remains traces which should of course
be cleared! Also other grant opportunities can and should be explored
(e.g. COST networks). And again: if anyone feels like taking on /
sharing the lead, please!!!
