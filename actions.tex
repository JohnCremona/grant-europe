\section{Actions}



\subsection{Collaborative tools}

\begin{itemize}
\item Development of an online repository for sharing notebooks and
  other Sage resources
  %\TODO{Be clearer: we want to get rid of notebooks over the
  %  filesystem and .sws tarball}
\item Workflow improvements: continuous integration, ...
\item Collaborative interactive tools: e.g. embedding live shared
  \sage sessions (and more generally IPython) in voice-over-IP or
  teleconference calls.
  % Eugen Dedu:
  % I think such a module can be thought of as a screen-capturing
  % module, i.e. allow Ekiga to capture the screen of a Sage user (this
  % is currently not possible).  This is not a difficult task to do.
  % NT: assuming read and write access is possible

  % Eugen Dedu:
  % In my opinion ekiga, because of its dependency on ptlib and opal
  % libraries and the use of complex protocols like SIP and H323, needs
  % highly technical people.  Students cannot help much, but engineers
  % are appropriate.

\end{itemize}

%\TODO{lmonade has very similar objectives but uses the gentoo prefix whereas Linux distributions use very different packaging systems:
%\begin{itemize}
%\item gentoo prefix (gentoo)
%\item pacman (arch),
%\item yum (redhat),
%\item apt (debian),
%\item easy\_install
%\item Python index packaging (pip)
%\end{itemize}}

\subsection{Modularization of the Sage distribution}
Separation of the different components of Sage (communication with third-party softwares, build system, Sage native code code). This is a prerequisite for easier packaging and integration in standard Linux distributions and lmonade, native integration within the IPython notebook and other interfaces (larchenv, Spyder, ...) and collaboration with sister projects.

\subsection{Deployment}
\begin{itemize}
\item Better Windows support
\item Live USB keys
\item Creation, deployment, and distribution of preconfigured virtual
machines for Sage as a cloud service, in particular within the
StratusLab infrastructure.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Interfaces with other computation systems}

\begin{itemize}
\item Support for \href{http://www.symbolic-computing.org/}{SCSCP}
%\item \TODO{expand}
\item foster collaboration with upstream libraries by sharing the
  development and maintenance of the interfaces (typically as
  standalone Python bindings)
\end{itemize}


\subsection{Dissemination and teaching}

\begin{itemize}
\item Documentation improvements: overview, cross links, overview of
  recent improvements
\item Thematic tutorials
\item Collections of pedagogical documents\\
  E.g. a complete collection of interactive class notes with computer
  lab projects for the ``Alg√®bre et Calcul formel'' option of the
  French math aggregation (starting from 2015, only open-source
  systems will be supported, and Sage is a major player).
  % See http://nicolas.thiery.name/Enseignement/Agregation/ as a starter
\item indexation of notebooks and tutorials in a database accessible through a
  web interface
\item Massive online introduction course to Sage, drawing on the sage tutorial/notebooks.
Could be "First year \sage course in a box"
%\item \TODO{please expand!}
\end{itemize}

% Jeroen: About teaching: in Gent, Sage is already integrated in the
% courses (maybe you can add this, don't know if it's relevant)
% starting in the first year. It's good for the students because it
% helps in 2 ways: it helps them to understand the mathematics better
% and it helps them to learn basic down-to-earth programming (they
% also have a programming course in Java but that contains a lot of
% theory about complicated class structures)
% Same thing in Orsay
% More python centered but same in UZH

\subsection{Community animation and training}

\begin{itemize}
\item Sage Days (training workshops and developers meetings)
\item Exchange visits for students, researchers, ... in between
  partner institutions, and with developers worldwide
\item Strengthening of collaborations with sister projects: GAP,
  Linbox, Singular, PARI/GP, IPython, Scientific Python, R, to name but a
  few.
%\item \TODO{please expand}
\end{itemize}



\subsection{Math features}

\begin{itemize}
\item Foundation work: categories, morphisms, coercion, ...
\item Generic parallelism tools for combinatorics
\item Representation theory of monoids and algebras
\item Ore algebras and applications to combinatorics
\item Further development of combinatorial species
\item Automatons and combinatorics on words
  % Interface with Vaucanson, ...
  % https://github.com/coulbois/sage-train-track
  % https://www.lrde.epita.fr/wiki/Vaucanson
  % More support for group theory (especially free group automorphisms, mapping class group of surfaces, braid groups)
\item Symbolic dynamical systems (substitutive systems, Bratelli diagrams,
  sofic shifts, tilings, interval exchange transformations)
\item Manifolds (symbolic computations in charts, differential equations, etc)
  % http://sagemanifolds.obspm.fr/
\item Intersection theory in algebraic geometry
  % http://www.math.sciences.univ-nantes.fr/~sorger/chow_en.html
\item ...
%\item \TODO{please expand!}
\end{itemize}
